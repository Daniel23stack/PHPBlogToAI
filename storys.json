{"storys":[["I'm on the train, not sat as there were no free seats when I got aboard, when it stops slowly, announcing: 'You arrived at: Nova Ponte Station'. Bah, I'm still far from Cidade Velha Station, where I'll leave the train and go to the office.\nOh, by the way, I'm Hector. An ordinary man, with an ordinary life, doing a not-so-ordinary job in an ordinary office in the center of a nice touristic city. And today is just another ordinary day for me. No, I'm not complaining: I like my routine and I can say I love my life. Sometimes I hang out with friends, having some non-ordinary fun but most of the time, I just go work and then I go home. On the weekends I play games and watch series. I'm very comfortable, honestly.\nAnd, as I said, today is just another day. Through a window on the opposite side of the train, I see houses and buildings passing fast, I see the sky getting sunny with some white clouds, some trees here and there put some green in the scenery… it's a beautiful day: who said ordinary days can't be beautiful?\n'You arrived at: Cruz Osório Station'.\nOww! I should've waited some minutes more to board the fast train! This one's way slower than I thought!\nI see people getting aboard, looking for places to sit, and, on the opposite side, a young woman, seemingly around her early twenties, gets aboard too. As all the seats are occupied, she just leans close to the door, absentmindedly opening her slightly large purse and taking a bag of cookies from there.\nMy heart starts beating a bit faster. I love seeing pretty women eating. And that woman is indeed beautiful. A slightly lean body with nice C-cup breasts, brown eyes, olive skin, nice legs, pretty curves… a gorgeous woman to put my eyes on. I stay a little while just admiring her figure.\nBut the most attractive part of a woman's body for me is the mouth. I pay special attention to her mouth, her lips parting a bit when she prepares to put a cookie inside… oh, I forgot to mention: I'm a vore fan. This is why I like so much to watch women eating, for me there's nothing more sensual and hot than this. I look in anticipation as her lips keep parting and… no! She turns her head to the other side, blocking my view of her mouth. She shoves a cookie in her mouth, closing it and starting to chew. After a little while, she swallows.\nWhat a lucky cookie!\nI try to see any bulge going down her neck but my point of view doesn't help me that much now. The woman inserts her hand in the bag, grabbing another very lucky cookie, and looks in my direction.\nI quickly look slightly away, pretending to be reading a warning closer to her. She's not looking directly at me as far as I can observe through my peripheral vision, she's just looking in my direction while eating another cookie. Dammit! Please, lady, look away! I wanna look at you while you consume those fortunate cookies!\nShe stays looking in my direction, lost in thought and eating her cookies. Soon, she looks in another direction and I can finally look directly at her. Discreetly of course, but directly at her. I watch as her lips part again, and I catch a glimpse of part of the insides of her sexy mouth: the reddish inner skin, some pearl-white teeth, the tip of her pinkish tongue… but it's very quick and she closes her mouth, leaving me dreaming about being the cookie she just shoved in there. She begins chewing and soon she gulps, now I have a nice view of a very slight bulge going down, another lucky cookie… I bet her stomach is very warm and soft…\nAgain, the woman looks in my direction as the door opens and more people come aboard. The train gets more full and a seat is freed right beside me. I sit there and now I can't see the young woman anymore, lots of people blocking my view of her. Well, that's ok: seeing pretty women giving food a happy end inside their tummies is something very good, but being sat during this slow train trip… ah, I can't waste that chance!\nNow, back to some random thoughts: maybe later I'll have lunch at Jamil's Kitchen, I heard they have nice food and the prices are attractive… but I don't know. I lean my head back, stretching and closing my eyes… just an ordinary morning. Soon I will arrive at Cidade Velha Station and proceed to work. I hope the day goes fine and nice… yesterday was heavy metal and I deserve an easy day today.\n~~~ * * * * * ~~~\nI feel myself being lightly tossed around and I open my eyes, yawning. I must have fallen asleep… I hope I didn't lose the sta- OH MY GOSH!\nWhere am I!? My eyes shot open and I look around, it's darker around me, the walls are… sort of shiny silver and seem to be thin as paper… and there are strange, huge circular objects all around me. Something huge moves here inside, grabbing one of these circular objects and taking it upward. I look upwards, seeing as this stran- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!\nIt's the woman I was observing! From the opening above me, I can see her gigantic face, she's looking so lost in thought with her face pointing forward as she looks to whatever she wants to look, not minding to look down here, exactly like she was doing when I was looking at her! It's like… I… uh… I don't know how to process that! My whole body starts shaking, I don't know if it's fear, surprise, I… I'm inside her bag of cookies! The big round objects are her cookies, no wonder they smell sweet! I look upward again in time to see her swallowing, and her huge hand again comes inside, grabbing another cookie for her to consume.\nI think about screaming, but I realize that I'm actually shaking in a strange sort of excitement and I don't wanna exactly scream for help. I'm a bit scared, sure, this is so new that I don't know what to do or how to react, but my mind starts processing better my current situation and… well, if everything goes well, this woman will… eat me. The expected sheer terror of being eaten alive isn't here, in its place there's a growing excitement with a hint of fear and that's all. I don't scream, just staying here, waiting to see what will happen to me.\nAgain, her hand comes down into the bag and she grabs another cookie. This time I don't call it lucky, maybe because of the hint of fear I'm feeling. I look upward and she stops with the cookie in front of her partially open mouth, she seems to be paying attention to something. Just some seconds pass by and she resumes eating, shoving the cookie into her mouth and closing her lips shut, starting then to chew, as she's been doing since entering this train and grabbing her bag of cookies.\nI gasp in surprise as her hand comes in again and one of her slender, well-manicured fingers brushes on me. It grabs me with a random cookie and I start being lifted real quick, but for no known reason, I start falling with some crumbs down back into the pack, followed by some bigger pieces of cookie, some of them falling on top of me.\nI hear the young woman sighing a bit annoyed: the cookie just broke in her fingers and fell back. She gives the bag a quick shake, sending the broken pieces and other crumbs down under the bigger cookies, and at the same time making me experience a real earthquake. My body is tossed against many hard cookies and it hurts a bit, but it stops as quickly as it began.\n'You arrived at: Cidade Velha Station'.\nI just am at the station where I'd have to disembark the train but you know, it's not possible now. I hear people walking in and out of the train, and soon the doors close, the train again going its way.\nGreat. I lost the station. Should I be feeling annoyed? I mean, I know I should, but… I feel like I don't care, actually. I'm inside a beautiful woman's bag of cookies, with a chance of being eaten… am I really caring about what station I lost?\n\n\nThe answer is a big NO. I have better things to think about…\nThe woman again shoves a hand here inside. This time, her fingers don't come close to me and as her hand takes a cookie, another one falls on my leg, but I easily free myself. I grab a crumb and bite it, it's tasty… very sweet.\nWhile I'm savoring another bite, the woman's fingers come down and grab another cookie… this time grabbing me together once more. Her grip is soft but firm and in a quick motion I see myself being lifted out of the bag and then shoved into her warm mouth; I barely have time to register the reddish insides of her mouth as I am inserted into it, being at least lucky enough to see her deep, dark throat as she closes her mouth.\nDarkness. Wet, stuffy darkness. Her tongue quickly starts moving the cookie and my body around, moistening us with her warm and slightly sticky saliva.\n\"Oh no…\" I almost stutter as I think about what comes next…\nChewing.\nCRUNCH\nI hear the frightening crunching sounds around me, such sounds becoming more and more wet and soft as the cookie is chewed down into a creamy bolus. As for me, I'm kept on her tongue, she didn't push me onto her molars as she did with the unfortunate cookie. Oh, interesting, now I call the cookie unfortunate? Haha, what a joke. We are both being eaten, and I hope she feels me and spits me out instead of chewing me too. Hard vore isn't my cup of tea… well, sometimes I enjoy stories with hard vore but if I'm to be eaten, I prefer it to be soft.\nI feel a strong pressure making my head and body feel like they're gonna sort of explode, her tongue lifts and presses me on the roof of her mouth… GULP. She swallows.\nBut I'm still in her mouth, held by her tongue.\nJust two or three seconds later, her mouth opens again and strong light enters it, blinding me just slightly as another cookie enters this wet cavern, some fresh air mixing with her now sweet breath. Her lips close and more chewing begins. Again, I feel her tongue pinning me on the roof of her mouth as she chews, I'm spared. The woman seems to be… aware of my presence here? Does she know?\nBut… but how is this possible, to begin with? I'm inside the mouth of a woman, this is beyond surreal, this defies imagination! I don't know how all that is happening, but… well, later I'll think about it. There will be 'later' for me, won't it?\nAgain, I feel a strong pressure all around me but this time her tongue frees and maneuvers me together with a wet, sweet pulp that was once a cookie. The tongue presses me together with the bolus and, in a swift movement, pushes me forward. An overly strong embrace, together with a well-known sound, immediately forces me into a tight place which leads to a slimy tube…\nShe just swallowed me.\nI think about finally shouting, about calling for help, but… THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!! If I'm gonna shout, it will be a shout of utter joy! But her esophagus is compressing me so hard that it takes all the air out of my lungs, my arms pinned to my sides as I am pushed downward with the chewed cookie by tight undulating movements…\nHer calm heartbeats are getting louder and, after a very slight turn, I reach a tight opening and my body is pushed into a larger space. I fall into a sloshing pool that, I must be honest, smells like chemicals and vomit with hints of sweet, not a good atmosphere to breathe but I don't think I have any choice now. I cough a bit, yet I am very excited about what's happening. It's a wish coming true!\nI was eaten. Whole, alive… eaten!\nBut how? This still doesn't make sense… everything is too real to be a dream… the warmth of the bolus mixing in the juices down here, the strong smell all around, the bodily sounds… it can't be just a dream! Oh gosh it can't be!\nHer bodily sounds are entrancing, even her gurgles excite me as they show me where I am in the food chain compared to that woman. And as I try to swim in this sloshing, creamy sea of chewed cookies mixing with digestive juices, I feel something probably as large as me falling into it with a noticeable plop sound.\nYeah, another chewed cookie. She's still eating. I can't hear the chewing or anything outside her torso but I'm pretty sure, despite not being able to see a thing, that she's eating. There are still some cookies to be eaten, as far as I can remember, so maybe I'll hear more plops around.\nA loud gurgle, followed by a strong contraction of her stomach walls, pushes me onto a wall on the other side of her stomach. I manage to grab at the slightly slimy wall, feeling its wrinkles and its heat. I almost can feel the blood being pumped in its many blood vessels! It's… it's wonderful! I'm in paradise!\nI know I'm late for work, but who cares? I'm on some sort of day off and I will enjoy. Never in my life I thought I would be inside a pretty woman's digestive tract for real! I'm living something most GTS fans out there can only imagine!!\nA strong movement of her gut sends a hot wave of semi-digested food over me, forcing me to go swirling down into the depths of her partially full stomach. Her stomach's moving and flexing way more and I'm already starting to feel some very light itching on my skin… yes, she's starting to digest me.\nWho cares?\nAnother chewed cookie falls into here, this one right on top of me. I clean it off of my face and I start to laugh, happy: this surely isn't just an ordinary day! I don't know if I'll ever leave this place and how, but if I could choose, I'd prefer to live here forever! Why waste my life with work, friends, and all? I can stay inside this woman's stomach forever and be as happy as I never was. I already feel like that!\nSuddenly, I hear strange sounds far above me, and soon a cold torrent comes rushing and washing everything, liquefying way more the creamy sea where I'm afloat.\nShe's drinking something, maybe juice, or soda… I don't know, it's hard to smell things down here because of the strong vomit smell all around but I think there are hints of sweet in the smell of this liquid. It doesn't take long for the torrent to end and now the stomach is sloshing its contents way more with me afloat in an almost raging sea of digesting food, the stomach walls contracting and flexing, working on the now almost liquefied content.\nMy skin is burning a bit more and this sensation is now a bit annoying, but I still don't care. I stay afloat, enjoying my stay in this pretty woman's tummy and wondering how much time it will take for her sexy body to fully process me and make me part of her…\n~~~ * * * * * ~~~\n'You arrived at: Algarve Station'.\nAlisha disembarks, throwing an empty bag of cookies, together with an empty soda can, in the nearest trash bin as she walks. Licking her lips as she enjoys the aftertaste of the snack she ate, Alisha pats her belly, looking down at it briefly.\n\"You wished for it… enjoy,\" she whispers with a subtle, warm smile.\n\n~~~ The End ~~~\n\n"],["A few minutes have passed since break time ended and some students are still in the hallways, either coming back from a quick visit to the restroom or just talking a few last things with a classmate from another class. Bruna passes among them in a bit of a hurry, ignoring some looks from people who don't understand why she's going in the opposite direction of the classes. 'It's nobody's business,' the azure-eyed blonde justifies, as usual. She already has a desired place to be and soon arrives at the open area of the campus, doing a quick jog toward the old building, which is still used but has some floors completely deactivated, although still accessible. Those empty rooms have no use but for a few couples to have sex out of sight, but for Bruna... there's something even more secret she wants to do.\n\"Hey you…\" a student she passes by offers her a black-and-white printed flier. \"If you know anything about it, please call the number printed on the back.\"\n\"Oh, sure,\" Bruna takes the flier without giving the guy proper attention, not out of insolence or arrogance, she's just in a hurry: her class must be starting already and she doesn't have more than fifteen, maybe twenty minutes per week for tardiness. She used to do what she's gonna do at home, but with the arrival of a baby sister and the consequent routine changes, she had to choose another place.\n'Ten minutes are enough,' she smiles, licking her lips as she thinks about what she's about to do. Her stomach, empty since it digested her breakfast and now stirred up by her delicious thoughts, complains mercilessly, causing the 22 years old woman's abdomen to feel a little uncomfortable and making her quicken her pace.\nAdjusting her long straight hair a little, Bruna passes by another student, who also hands her a flier, the same one she had received before. She thanks him, immediately noticing that the young man has a tiny sitting on his shoulder: tiny is what are called humans who, due to genetic conditions that are becoming more common each year, cannot be more than 6 or 7 cm (2.2 or 2.8 inches) tall.\nFor a fraction of a second, Bruna's gaze meets the tiny's brown eyes and she notices the subtle shiver on the tiny's body. Something only he felt when she looked at him… a strange primal fear, as if that girl could somehow put him in a life-threatening situation…\nThis time, Bruna reads the flier: it's a paper that shows missing persons. Missing tinies, specifically. There has been a strong campaign in several places where tiny people have disappeared recently in search of people who capture and hurt or even kill those little humans. Tinies, of course, have all the rights a normal-sized human also has, and, for example, trapping a tiny in a purse and taking him home is considered kidnapping as it's considered kidnapping to lock a normal-sized human in a trunk and take him under false imprisonment.\nBruna enters the old campus building, crumpling and throwing the fliers she received into the nearest trash can, and uses the stairs to go up two floors, soon finding the room she likes the most: 2-206. This room is located almost at the end of the hallway, hidden behind some old furniture that was piled up there months ago. Access to that room is a little hard and Bruna has to squeeze herself a little between the furniture to get through and enter the room, but once inside, she closes the door…\n\"Well, well…\" she whispers with an eager smile, opening her purse as she sits down on a random seat…\n\"HEEEEEELP!!\"\n\"LET ME OUT, PLEASE!!\"\n\"ARE YOU CRAZY!? I'LL REPORT YOU WHEN THIS IS OVER!\"\n\"SOMEBODY HELP US!!\"\nBruna smiles wider as she hears the screams of the tinies she captured during the morning, which wasn't an easy task, but years of experience helped a lot…\n\"Keep screaming, I don't think anyone can hear you all that much... anyone but me, of course...\" she teases, and the tinies try to hide behind one of the many objects inside Bruna's purse when they see her hand going in, her long fingers quickly capturing a tiny who vainly tries to bite her, his face not being in position for his teeth to reach her skin. Bruna lifts him until he is in front of her eyes, which for him are like huge eyes of clear azure with the pupil, in the center, visibly adjusting itself to focus on a creature with such tiny facial details.\n\"Today's your lucky day, little guy…\"\nIshiro, a tiny of obvious Asian bloodline, stares frightened at the face of the giantess who speaks to him. A strong shiver runs through his body when he remembers the local news about missing tinies at this college and understands that this young woman may be behind some of the cases if not all of them. He, who was believing that what's happening was just another prank from his normal-sized friends, now is close to peeing out of fear.\n\"What y-you gonna do!?\" he stutters, squirming vigorously as he tries to push her fingers away and free himself.\n\"You'll see…\" Bruna tilts her head back a little, opening her mouth wide and placing Ishiro inside. He screams in bigger desperation, kicking, flailing, all the while feeling his body being deposited on her hot, very wet tongue. A damp, minty atmosphere envelops him as Bruna's lips close, leaving him in darkness.\n\"Hmmmm…\" Bruna moans in pleasure, starting to taste the tiny while looking at the others, choosing the next one… The remaining tinies in the bag stare scared at the scene, hearing muffled screams and seeing quick bumps appearing and disappearing randomly on Bruna's cheeks. One or two tinies can swear they can tell when the bump is a hand or a foot…\nEnjoying not only the slightly salty taste of Ishiro but also the moment of growing panic among the remaining tinies, Bruna leisurely passes her fingers among her things in her purse, scaring a little more the tinies in there while visibly using her tongue to push Ishiro from a side to another inside her mouth. Then Bruna brings the purse closer to her face and opens her mouth…\n\"ISHIROOO!!\" another tiny screams, seeing Ishiro soaked in warm saliva and slipping as he tries to get up. Ishiro screams and begs for help, but Bruna's tongue doesn't let him gain ground, knocking him down every time he manages to get up despite all the saliva.\nAnd again, Bruna's huge mouth closes.\n\"Buh-bye…\" she says to the tinies in her purse, tilting her head back a little and letting everyone in her purse see a big bulge going down her neck, a bulge that squirms with muffled cries as Bruna's esophagus welcomes him, guiding him on a one-way trip to the dark depths of the giantess' hungry stomach…\n\"Aaahhhh~\" she opens her mouth, showing it empty. Just her tongue, the rosy walls of her cheeks, teeth… and her throat at the back, the uvula hanging as if it's welcoming the remaining tinies down into the dark tunnel towards Bruna's tummy insides.\nIshiro was swallowed.\n\"You guys have no idea how de-li-cious you guys are!\"\n\"YOU BITCH, YOU ATE HIM! YOU ATE ISHIRO! THIS IS CRIME! THIS IS CRIME! WE ARE HUMANS!!\" another tiny, a light brown skinned one who would be quite tall if he was normal-sized, yells at her, his eyes showing that his anger stems from deep despair.\n\"Ahhhn, you're pretty eager, aren't you?\" she grabs him in a swift move, throwing him unceremoniously into her mouth and closing it.\n~~~ * * * * * ~~~\n\"*gaahn* HEEEL– *cough cough* HE– *cough cough cough gahn*\" Vagner chokes with the gallons of warm, almost imperceptibly viscous saliva in which he's soaked every time Bruna's tongue sloshes him from one side to another, extracting all the flavor from him. He tries to punch, kick, sometimes grab her tongue or whatever; sometimes he feels some part of his body bumping into a tooth or he's squeezed against a cheek... he can barely breathe, but his instincts are at their peak and he fights as he has never thought it was possible, his life depends on it.\nBut a tiny doesn't stand a chance against a woman like Bruna, and soon he's mercilessly pushed by her strong tongue into her throat, where he's wrapped in an incredibly strong muscular embrace that forces him into an extremely tight tube, being propelled downward with slow, undulating movements… This is the end for Vagner.\n~~~ * * * * * ~~~\nThe tinies in the purse watch Bruna sliding a finger on the bulge that goes down her neck, another unlucky tiny that is now on his way to the inevitable digestion inside her tummy.\n\"Mmmm… this one's fighting a lot more, I bet he's gonna make a real mess down here…\" Bruna looks at her own belly, softly rubbing it. \"Ah, I have an idea!\"\nBruna lifts her shirt a little, exposing her flat belly, sculpted by a balanced diet plus almost daily visits to the gym, and sits on the floor, leaning against a wall, with her purse with her. She carefully picks up the tinies in her purse and places them on her belly…\n\"Underneath you are your little friends… only a thin layer of skin and flesh separates them from you… but that's okay,\" she winks at them with a slightly mischievous smile, \"soon you'll all be together… I bet you can barely wait! And whoever tries to escape will face worse treatment…\"\n\"TOGETHER YOUR AS–\"\n\"Watch your mouth…!\" she grabs one of the tinies before he finishes speaking, preparing to put him in her mouth... but she sees something different: in the corner of the room, hidden behind a varnished wooden object... there is a tiny girl. She looks shy but doesn't step back when she realizes Bruna saw her, just blushing a lot.\nRaising an eyebrow, suspicious of this tiny spectator's shy bravery, Bruna places the tiny she was about to consume back on her tummy, staring at the tiny girl with a very curious look.\n\"So… this is the part where you should be screaming, yelling for help… don't you think so?\"\n\"I… I…\" the tiny girl tries to speak, blushing. Her shyness is a little stronger and she tries to speak out, fearing being eaten right away.\n\"'I… I…' Go on, we're all curious. Me and your friends here on my belly.\"\nThe small girl starts walking towards Bruna, still very shy and a little wary. \"I… like… w–\"\n\"What?\" Bruna interrupts her, smiling in surprise. \"I never heard of a tiny that likes to be eaten!\"\n\"No, I don't want to be eaten, never!\" the tiny girl almost steps back, shyly shaking her head. \"I… I like to watch giantesses like you eat people my size…\"\n\"NO WAY!\" one of the tinies on Bruna's belly feels so astonished by the tiny girl's words that his astonishment gets mixed with anger. \"AT LEAST DO A BETTER EXCUSE!\"\n\"Really? So… I'll give you a chance: come here,\" Bruna rests her extended palm on the ground while, with her other hand, she captures the tiny who just screamed, firmly wrapping her fingers around him. \"I promise I won't eat you, I just want to show you something…\"\nThe tiny girl takes a wary step towards Bruna, then another... and another... until she's in front of Bruna's huge palm, contemplating Bruna's long fingers, looking at her face and seeing her apparently docile countenance, which contrasts with her slightly mischievous look…\n\"Well… if you were lying, I think you'd already have grabbed me, wouldn't you?\" the tiny young woman climbs onto the palm, feeling Bruna lifting her hand and bringing it close to her mouth. The tiny girl's heart starts to beat faster and she thinks that maybe she made the wrong decision, but Bruna winks reassuringly at her.\n\"So you like… seeing this?\" Bruna places the tiny who screamed over her mouth, now wide open. Gently, Bruna places the hand where the tiny girl is standing a little closer to her head, letting her watch closely as the other tiny is released and falls screaming inside Bruna's mouth, which closes immediately. The tiny girl, visibly excited, blushes, feeling some warmth growing between her legs, sighing softly when she sees how the giantess so easily holds a tiny inside her mouth as if it was a simple snack, Bruna's pink lips tightly closed and moving while she savors her new little victim. The tiny girl notices when Bruna is going to swallow and stares at her neck, 100% of her attention focused on the moment, and then it happens: a loud gulp almost echoes in the tiny girl's ears and something agitated and slightly larger than herself goes down inside Bruna's neck, a large bulge that can only be a tiny human that has just been swallowed alive.\n\"Aaahhhh~…\" Bruna sighs in pure ecstasy, looking at the little person in her hand. \"Did you enjoy watching this?\"\n\"Yes…! Yes!\" the tiny girl, now less shy, confesses, smiling more excitedly. \"I've always wanted to see it up close like this... th-thanks!\"\n\"You're welcome… but what's your name again?\"\n\"Mia.\"\n\"Nice to meet you, I'm Bruna. I never expected that a tiny like you would enjoy watching me swallow other tinies… it could be you, right?\" Bruna winks at her again.\n\"Yeah… but… I…\"\n As Mia stutters a bit, unsure of what Bruna has in mind, the latter places the former on her neck. Mia understands exactly what Bruna wants and hugs the giantess' wide, warm neck, pressing her ear against Bruna's skin. As unbelievable as it may seem, Mia has the feeling that she heard something besides Bruna's bodily sounds. Something that might as well be a distant, terrified scream…\nBruna, delighted with Mia's sincere excitement, picks up another tiny, this time a guy who had studied with her in another class, and hastily throws him into her mouth. Lubricating him a little with her saliva, Bruna swallows him quickly and Mia feels a bulge about her size passing inside Bruna's neck, pushing her as it goes down, the muffled screams of this new victim clearly audible. As he's pushed down the esophagus, his screams get harder and harder to hear... until they're silenced when the sphincter that connects the esophagus to the stomach closes after the tiny passes through it.\nIn the small instant in which the sphincter was open, Mia heard more screams.\n\"Wow…\"\n\"Glad you liked it…\"\n\"Yeah…! I… I… Can I s-stay on your belly? I want to hear… hear more,\" Mia asks timidly, receiving a wide, sincere smile from Bruna in return.\n\"You're cute, you know that?\" Bruna gently picks Mia up and places her on her belly, just below her left breast, where Mia immediately lies down on her tummy, pressing her ear against Bruna's wide, sexy abdomen and listening, fully attentive, to the ongoing chaos inside her giant friend's turbulent stomach…\nAmidst heartbeats, Bruna's lungs filling with air as she inhales, stomach rumblings, and some other sounds Mia can't identify, the tiny girl manages to notice exactly what she's looking for: screams. All of them muffled but still sufficiently clear and desperate…\n\"Hey!\" Mia almost jumps out of her place, a bit startled. \"I-I think one of them punched right under me her- ouch! Another one! They're really frantic!\"\n\"Yeah, I feel them too… it's like a massage, you know?\" Bruna grabs the last tiny, throwing him in her mouth and sucking his body like candy. \"It's so tasty… I can hear just a little bit of their screams… they punch, kick, protest… poor things, they're trapped and won't get out…\"\n\"Yeah, they're screaming a lot… it's kind of hard to understand everything, but I think they're begging… they're wanting to get out… there's one here who's demanding you to puke him up!\" Mia smirks at the tiny who, inches below her, is screaming at the top of his lungs, lost in the darkness amid the strong, tight contractions of Bruna's stomach, he and other tinies being jumbled and squeezed against each other and against the stomach walls as they ooze acids on their desperate bodies, preparing them for digestion. One of the tinies, panicking, throws a hard punch against a random wall that has flexed. \"Wow, again? They punch too much!\" Mia, on top of them and outside, feels the blow, once more surprised.\n\"Yeah… they try really hard… too bad it only lasts about… fifteen or twenty minutes…\" Bruna continues to savor the tiny she sucks like candy, leaning her head back and closing her eyes, enjoying the incredibly good sensations the intense fight inside her stomach provides her. Mia, still lying down on Bruna's belly and seeing that Bruna is no longer looking at her, gives in to her most hidden desire and her hand goes down under her belly, then goes inside her skirt, from there going inside her panties, and one of her fingers touches her clit. Mia blushes a little more, feeling a slight shiver in her legs and holding back a moan that, had it been released, would surely bring onto her the attention of the giantess on whose belly she lies…\nNow Mia also closes her eyes, taking a deep breath and restraining her moans as she hums and almost gasps in pleasure, touching herself while listening to Bruna as the latter delights herself with the tiny in her mouth. Mia's legs, shaking a little in pleasure, spread a little more, giving Mia's fingers wider access to her vagina, which awaits further attention…\n\"AHHGHN!\" Mia, surprised, almost screams startled when she feels something big, soft, and warm caressing her back.\n\"Someone's really excited…\" Bruna laughs softly, trying to calm Mia down. \"You… eh… I also think that digesting the tinies is something very sexy, you know? It's not just the pleasure of eating something tasty… it's knowing that they're right here, in my belly, doing everything they can and even so, they won't be able to escape… from the moment I capture them, their fate is sealed, and that fate is to be food to fuel my body…\" Bruna pats her own abdomen very lightly as she feels the struggles inside her belly intensifying: surely the tinies there inside heard her words.\n\"It's true… it turns me on since I became a teenager…\" Mia whispers, blushing like never before. \"I… I…\"\n\"Let me help you…\" Bruna slips one of her huge fingers between Mia's legs, who holds back another moan as she feels her legs being unforcedly opened by Bruna's fingertip. The giantess applies a very arousing pressure in Mia's most intimate region like Mia has never felt before… \"Just close your eyes… and enjoy everything with me…\" \n\nMia, finally, completely surrenders, turning around and wrapping her arms and legs around Bruna's finger, rhythmically and continuously rubbing herself on it while Bruna lightly masturbates her, carefully touching and caressing the tiny girl's wet pussy. The giantess, wanting to take part in this moment, uses her other hand on herself, feeling no qualms about having this particular moment with a girl she just met. Bruna's fingers enter her vagina and she moans a little louder, followed by tinier moans from Mia, who also allows herself to moan more. The two girls touch themselves together, growing more and more horny as they hear each other's moans, the complicity in that intimate moment increasing the pleasure of this experience to levels neither of them had ever felt before. Mia takes an extra delight in keeping herself aware that while Bruna is giving her pleasure like she never had before, four people as tiny as herself are trapped, screaming and hitting every wall of Bruna's stomach as they beg to be freed. The vibrations that their futile efforts cause to the surface of Bruna's tummy vibrate through Mia's body who, enraptured by the unique experience, reaches an intense orgasm. Never has it arrived so quickly; even so the climax was unique, one of the strongest she has felt. She moans as loud as a tiny can, grabbing Bruna's finger with her nails, which presses her on the right spots, giving her some last stimuli while the tiny girl's body calms down…\nMia sighs deeply, now resting while hugging Bruna's finger, panting and already a bit sweaty while Bruna still touches herself, moaning softly. \"Go on… swallow him for me~…\" Mia teases, stirring an extra ecstasy in Bruna, who tilts her head down a bit, opening her mouth just a little so that the tiny there inside can have one last view of the outside world. Bruna's eyes say it all: she wants Mia to tell the tiny what's going to happen…\n\"Hey, dude… I don't think we're gonna see each other again…\" Mia waves the unfortunate guy bye-bye.\nHe screams in protest but is interrupted when Bruna's mouth closes, this time to swallow him. Mia tries to reach Bruna's neck to again feel a tiny go down her esophagus, but when Bruna swallows, she is still passing over the giantess' huge breasts. The tiny girl notices Bruna's breathing accelerating and holds on tight, enduring the sudden earthquake that Bruna's body causes her during the climax. She waits for Bruna to calm down, only then returning to her belly.\n\"Wow, it must be wonderful to feel them inside your belly… are their movements very strong?\" Mia asks, starting to rhythmically rub Bruna's belly, smiling at her new friend.\n\"Strong enough for me to feel them well… sometimes I feel something a bit different, I don't know how to describe everything I feel. But they mostly kick, push, punch… I think that they even already tried to scratch the walls of my stomach!\" Bruna giggles and Mia laughs along. \"Their fight doesn't start in the stomach, at least not for most of them. In my mouth they already struggle a lot and keep trying when they are sliding down my esophagus... but in there they move less, I guess it must be a super tight descent for them, so tight that I feel them go the whole way down as if they were a large mass of food going tightly down… well, in fact, they are,\" she giggles again. \"But when they reach my stomach… it's when they make a real mess! I feel so many things, they try so hard… but it's no use, they'll stay here inside, trapped forever, until… I digest them. It's so good, it's a moment worth all the risk of being caught capturing those little people… I'll never get tired of doing that!\"\n\"Yeah, I'm feeling and hearing everything! They're screaming for you to release them… they're even promising that if you puke them up they won't tell anyone… of course you'll never do that, right? Puke them out here?\"\n\"No… they're food, and food is meant to stay in my belly… \" she sighs, feeling immense pleasure with Mia's touches on her belly. \"Mmm… what are you doing? This feels soooo good…\"\n\"A massage... while they massage you on the inside, I'll massage you on the outside.\"\n\"Ahh… this feels great…\" Bruna rests her head against the wall, closing her eyes as she relaxes with Mia's massage and revels in the fluttering inside her stomach, which is starting to grow weaker… \"I could stay like this forever…\"\n\"Me too…\" Mia continues the massage, enjoying knowing that, below her, about five tinies are unable to get out of Bruna's stomach, no matter how much they try or beg. An unusual, forbidden pleasure that Mia never understood why she had it, but she does. She can feel the tinies still a little unquiet beneath her, a few faint, sporadic bumps appearing and disappearing in different parts of Bruna's belly, in the area related to the stomach. Giving extra attention to the moment, Mia hears their still perceptible voices and screams among the loud stomach gurgles that every now and then disturb the understanding of much that is said:\n\"Let us out…!\"\n\"I don't wanna die here, help!!\"\n\"You bitch, this is hurting a lot!!\"\n\"I can't take it anymore…! Let us go, please!\"\n\"Help…! Someone help us!\"\n\"Not this way, please!!\"\n\"If you let us g–\"\nGRRROOOAAAN…!\n\"Please… please…\"\n Mia looks happily at Bruna, who smiles back affectionately and picks her up in her hand as she gets up.\n\"So… friends?\" Mia asks while Bruna dusts her clothes, getting ready to leave.\n\"Friends. And… maybe more~\"\nMia can barely contain herself, happy to have found a normal-sized woman who fits her desires perfectly. \"And… that means you won't try to eat me, right?\"\n\"Of course not, you're my protegee now!\" Bruna handles Mia gently, leaving the tiny girl on her shoulder. The fluttering inside her stomach is starting to subside, though one or two tinies are still struggling, and she needs to go to the class, so it's really time to go back. \"If you feel like you're going to lose your balance, hold on to my hair.\"\n\"Okay!\" Mia sits on Bruna's shoulder, firmly grabbing a few blonde strands as Bruna leaves the room, taking her purse with her, now without a single tiny inside, all of them already confined inside her tummy, which emits a satisfied groan as it continues to digest the small humans, all still alive. Again Bruna squeezes herself a little between the furniture, then walking through the long, forgotten corridor of this deactivated floor and using the same stairs to return to the ground floor, once again jogging in the open area of the campus. She passes by the same guys who were handing out fliers earlier: now they are resting and talking. Even so, Bruna asks them for another flier and the guy, when giving her a new one, notices Mia sitting happily on Bruna's shoulder.\n\"Congrats, girl… you have a very friendly and positive attitude toward tinies!\" the boy praises Bruna without taking his eyes off Mia. Bruna says nothing, just nodding, but Mia lets out a mischievous giggle that leaves the boy a little confused.\n\"So…\" Bruna shows Mia the flier when they are a little further away from the guy. \"…are any of these faces familiar to you? Were any of them your friends?\"\n\"I… know some of these tinies, but no one on that list is a friend of mine. At most, they were class acquaintances. Why?\"\n\"Just checking… I must have swallowed all these…\"\n~~~ * * * * * ~~~\nOne day later, around 1:00 am…\n\"Aaaaahhhhhh~!!!!\" Bruna, almost squirming in pleasure, again comes to an orgasm, taking deep, long breaths as she keeps Mia pressed against her pussy, Mia massaging the huge clit she has been rubbed against so many times, clearly not minding being drenched in Bruna's vaginal fluids. For Mia, it actually was an extra that helped her to cum a lot faster too... a loving intimacy she never would have imagined having so quickly, so deeply, with a woman who could swallow her up anytime she wanted, but Mia knows she won't. They're girlfriends now.\n Out of nothing, Mia feels Bruna's fingers envelop her and the giantess leaves the tiny girl on one of her soft breasts, still panting, but calmer… \n\"This was…\"\n\"…perfection…\" Bruna moans one last time, withdrawing her fingers from inside her vagina and not bothering too much to dry them on a piece of clothing that has long been taken off when things between the two started to grow hotter. \"I… I just confirmed that making love to you is a hundred times better than anything else… I've never had so much pleasure in my life, even with another woman my size…\"\n\"We found out together then… but I was thinking… like, I don't exactly understand, Bruna… you could have eaten me yesterday when we met… didn't you eat me because I enjoyed watching you eat those boys?\"< /p>\n\n\"I didn't eat you because you had the guts to come to me when I told you to do so, even though you knew what I could do to you. I respect that and also your sincerity. And besides... you were the first tiny person that looked at me with such affectionate eyes… I felt that you really liked me at that time and that we could be–\"\nOne of the tinies inside Bruna's belly punches as hard as he can the inner wall of her stomach in an act of rage.\n\"FUCK YOU, I LIKED YOU TOO YOU BIT–\"\n\"Yeah, I can see you liked me…\" she cuts him off, surprised by the tiny guy's audacity. \"Should have thought of that before calling me a bitch.\"\nBruna, ignoring the protests of both this tiny guy and the other tinies she ate while making love to Mia, and looking fondly at her tiny girlfriend, involuntarily lets out a shy, soft burp.\n\"Ooops!\" Mia smiles, considering Bruna's burp to be cute.\n\"It happens…\" Bruna caresses Mia's face, blushing a little.\n\"Well, my love…\" Mia continues. \"How many people my size did you eat in your entire life? The way you get excited with this… it seems like something new for you.\"\n\"Ahhh, hon, I lost count a long time ago… but do you like the size my breasts have? Thank all the tinies I ate that became part of them~… I think we can have an idea of how many I ate with that…\"\n\"Then it was indeed a lot…!\" Mia tries to hug Bruna's visibly large breast, on which she is, giving it a kiss. \"Even if I was your size I would say they are big!\"\nBruna carefully picks Mia up, putting her tiny girlfriend on her shoulder as she gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom… time for a nice, relaxing shower together, and then they'll go back to bed and sleep, Mia snuggling on top of the warm belly of her giant girlfriend…\n\n~~~ The End ~~~\n\n"],["My hands are shaking a little but I am going to do this. It's been about two months since I can only think about Emily, I can hold it no more! She is the reason I can't sleep well: I'm waking up in the middle of every night, thinking about her. And when I finally get sleeping, I almost always end up dreaming of her... It's strange, not to say annoying, to be awake in the early hours, doing nothing but rolling on the bed, dreaming of having a nice, meaningful relationship with her, just to stay sleepy all day long after.\nWaking up from my thoughts, and already feeling my hands colder than before and still a bit shaky, I stand up, breathing deeply and swallowing my fears, feeling strange shivers through my spine as I start walking toward her desk. I'm coming from behind, so we didn't make eye contact yet, thank goodness. As I walk, I see Emily distraughtly typing data in an Excel sheet, her long, smooth, black straight hair combed in a ponytail, as usual. Her hands gently and rapidly type the keyboard, the numbers appearing at a fast pace on the screen as she's unaware of my approach...\nI feel my feet slowing down as my shyness reaches higher levels, and my heart is almost exploding in my chest. I breathe deeply again, trying not to stop to avoid failing again: last week I tried talking with Emily to invite her for a date, but my shyness went so high I felt dizzy and I ended up just going to the cafeteria to drink something and be back at my desk after. I was about to slap my own face multiple times after I saw the woman of my dreams going home with her friends, and I was, again, going home without successfully inviting her.\n\"Watch your step, man!\" Kline, a coworker, complains, and only then I wake up from my thoughts and realize I stumbled on his desk, almost dropping his coffee on the floor.\n\"Oh, sorry,\" I apologize, glancing at Emily and seeing that she's looking at me; she and a friend of hers at her side turn their eyes back to their computers, giggling and saying things I can't hear while glancing at me sometimes.\nSo this is it, I messed with everything again. She must think I'm a walking disaster, and she's right. I hate it! Why am I so awkward towards women?\nPondering about my new and most recent failure, I resume walking, but now I turn left, going to the bathroom. I need some lone space to contemplate another big fail of myself...!\nIn the bathroom, I look at my own reflection in the mirror, wondering about Emily: I always had a good friendship with her, but about two or three months ago, something changed. From then on, it became harder and harder to talk normally with her. Confidence runs away every time she comes closer to say something. Shyness, hands trembling and sweating a little, a strange, uncomfortably cold quiver running through my spine... dude, it's hard!\nIt's when the door swings open, and Kline enters the bathroom.\n\"Sorry bro, I did—\"\n\"Relax man,\" he waves his hands to show me there's no need to be sorry, \"I was just startled. About you... dreaming of Emily again?\" he gives me a light tap on my back, smirking.\n\"I'm a complete idiot! Dude, I'm horrible with girls!\" I sigh, not being able to face him while talking.\n\"Easy, man! Easy! She's just a girl! You know, you walk to a girl and ask her out. The worst thing she can do is give you a no. It's as simple as that. Also, many girls here say good things about you, they say you're a nice guy. This includes some of Emily's closest friends, as far as I know...\" he flashes her eyebrows, trying to make eye contact with me. I look at his eyes, he's smiling with confidence. If I just had half of his confidence...\n\"I... don't know...\"\n\"No, no, man! Stop being shy and go talk to Emily! You deserve her, man! And I believe you have very good chances of dating her,\" he tries to encourage me.\n\"Thanks... but now I flopped! Did you see how she looked at me?\"\n\"I did: she was smiling and giggling. Maybe she thinks you're… cute?\"\n\"Cute? I don't believe she'll ever date a guy like me!\"\n\"Well, it's up to you, no one can give the next step for you and Emily probably won't go after you if you don't go after her first,\" Kline shrugs, sighing. \"So do your part.\"\n\"Thanks,\" I sigh too, still leaning on the sink. \"I'll see what I can do.\"\n\"Just do it.\"\nKline leaves the bathroom, and I wash my face. Then, I wash my face again. My hands are still shaking a little bit. But... but...\nKline's right! It won't help me to just stay here, staring at my reflection, doing nothing! It's not time to be 'just friends' anymore. Emily is special; among many girls I met in life, she's the best. Her serene nature, beautiful voice, angelic blue eyes, tender lips... Despite my embarrassment, we still talk a bit regularly. Not as before I fell in love with her, but we still do.\n\"This time I'll do it!\" I say to myself, and then proceed in unwavering steps to the door, opening it and–\n...I stumble on Emily herself.\nShe almost loses her balance, but I'm quick and I get her by her arm, keeping her in place. The courage I was feeling oozes away in a fraction of a second; I start stuttering excuses to her.\n\"That's okay…\" she says shyly to me, fixing her hair a little, her sweet voice mesmerizing me almost instantly. I can't help looking at Emily head to toe, admiring for a second the young woman I have in front of me. I just hope she didn't note that.\n\"I'm so sorry Emily, I wasn't expecting you right there.\"\n\"Yeah, and I wasn't expecting you to leave the bathroom so fiercely too.\"\n\"Well… at least you weren't holding a coffee cup!\" I smile, scratching the back of my neck. Emily looks at me, then a smile forms on her lips, and she laughs a bit.\n\"I saw what happened before... are you okay?\"\n\"Sure, I guess... considering no one ended hurt. Or without his coffee,\" I laugh, trying to act confident.\n\"Exactly!\" she says smilingly, then turning and heading to the entrance of the female bathroom. \"See you.\"\n\"No, wait…!\"\n\"What's up?\" she turns to me, smiling again. She's walking very slowly towards me, shortening our distance. I don't know if she's doing it on purpose, but she's coming pretty close. My heart is alerting me that it's going to explode in anxiety, but I just swallow my nervousness and proceed to talk:\n\"Uh... eh...\" I begin, feeling my hands wanting to shake. I breathe deeply once, holding my emotions a bit more. \"Maybe you'd like to go on a dinner with me tonight.\"\n\"Uh... eh... yes. Why not?\" she nods, her pale white-skinned face becoming slightly red.\n\"I'm sorry, Emily, I... w–wait. Did you say 'yes'?\"\nShe giggles, nodding again.\n\"Yes, I said yes,\" the 24 years old brunette confirms, one of her hands running softly on her hair.\n\"It's... eh... ah... well, I... I'll see the place I'm gonna... I'll... we can go after... we can go home after the work and then I'll get you in your place.\"\nNow Emily's looking at me with a wider smile on her face. It's like she's liking to see me stuttering like a total idiot.\n\"I think... I think it'll be cool. You're nice anyway,\" she continues, giving another step in my direction. I stand in place, trying not to give a shy step backwards. \"But what place do you have in mind?\"\n\"Uh... eh...\" I keep stuttering, trying to think about some interesting place to take her out. Not any ordinary place, no, I wanna take her to a place that won't be less than unique.\nThis is when I remember a TV ad I saw about three days ago.\n\"Do you know a restaurant that... serves live food?\"\n\"Uh-hum, it's the Moon Shine. I ate there twice, they serve good food,\" she tells me, then her eyes widen a bit and her smile weakens as if she just remembered something worrisome. \"But... are you sure?\"\n\"Sure? Of course! I just want to have a good time with you.\"\n\"…there?\"\n\"Yes. What's wrong?\"\n\"Eh... it's because you'll just... nah, nothing,\" she shakes her head and smiles gently. \"Okay, uh... meet me at my place tonight, I'll... I'll send my address to your e-mail. See you,\" she waves goodbye, now turning faster and entering the female bathroom before I could speak anything else.\nAnd I stay in place, again frozen, but now in utter happiness: I did it! I finally invited Emily to go to a nice place with me this night!\nAnd the better part: Emily said yes!\n~~~ * * * * * ~~~\nSome time later, almost 8:30 pm...\nI'm humming a song I like a lot in my place after taking a good shower. I don't know exactly how to dress to meet Emily, so I choose to go more casual tonight.\n'I hope this isn't too simple for the date,' I look again at the mirror. I guess that's okay. I must be at 8:45 pm at her place, so it's better for me to get going.\nI get my phone, checking again Emily's address while I leave my house, lock the door, and enter my car, typing Emily's address on Waze to get the best route. It's not far from here, but I hope I don't get any traffic jam.\nI drive to her place and manage to get there just in time, stopping my car in front of her house. Before I turn the car engine off, I see a short, white-skinned woman dressed in a slightly short, sleeveless black dress coming to my car. Her silk hair is nicely combed and she's using bangs, which makes her look more romantic.\nIt's Emily.\nShe waves to me, a shy grin forming on her pink lips.\nI open the car door as she comes closer, letting her enter. She accommodates herself and looks at me, her face prettier than ever. Her black dress seems to be new but is rather simple too. Anyway, it looks so well on her body...\n\"To see you coming made me fully realize why you're called the tiny at the office,\" I joke. Being just about 5 feet (around 1,50 meters) tall, Emily's easily one of the shortest women I know. She looks at me, first with a wondering look, then her smile turns broader, and she relaxes on the seat.\n\"Is this the first thing you say to a woman on a date?\" she lets out a soft giggle. \"Why don't you praise my hair or something?\"\n\"Just had to tell you that!\" I laugh a bit, enjoying the moment while I start driving us to the restaurant. \"By the way, your hair looks fine, yes. Your dress too, if I can tell you that. It's perfect for you.\"\nI see by my peripheral vision as she looks gentler at me, then she turns her head and looks at the streets.\n\"Now I can call that a good start...\" Emily jokes back. \"I thought you were going to change your mind, by the way.\"\n\"Change my mind? Why?\" I try to act confident and hide the utter shyness that's trying to possess my mind.\n\"Nevermind,\" she whispers, still looking at the streets.\n\"I'd never guess you do live here,\" I continue. \"I walked around here so many times in the past. Can't remember seeing you around.\"\n\"Really? When?\"\n\"About... uh... about four years ago, I guess.\"\nHer eyes flash for an instant.\n\"So there's a chance we've met before! Well, before we'd met in the office!\"\n\"Maybe... I always thought your face was a bit familiar. Just a feeling, I can't actually remember you.\"\n\"But what did you do around here? This place has... nothing!\" she rolls her eyes, sighing in a funny way. \"Nothing but houses and some small shops. I live here because the rent is cheaper than other places near the office.\"\n\"Well, I think your place is pretty and silent, I like that. The neighborhood is nice too. I'd like to live here if I hadn't my house already.\n\"Umm, thanks,\" she smiles gently, now turning her face and looking directly at me. \"You're the first who tells me things like this about my neighborhood. But... you still didn't tell me what you did around here.\"\n\"Uh... maybe you're going to see me as the nerdy guy from now on, b–\"\n\"I already see you as the nerdy guy!\" she laughs, slapping my shoulder softly.\n\"Uh... nah, who cares?\" I laugh too. \"But I used to visit ComixPlazza a lot to buy magazines and... some collectible action figures.\"\n\"ComixPlazza!? Oh gosh really?\" she asks, now surprised, her voice visibly excited. \"I loved to be there! Too bad it closed down during lockdown!\"\n\"You? No, stop kidding, I can't believe it! You don't seem the kind of girl who'd be there!\"\n\"But I am! The owner, Richard, was a big friend of mine, and he always let me read any magazines I wanted without buying!\" she continues, while I'm still impressed that she frequented the same place I used to visit so many times... I try to remember any moment I saw her before... but I can't.\n\"I did know Richard too. Nice man, by the way. But what did you like to read there?\"\n\"Mostly DC, of course!\" she giggles.\n\"No!\" I fake a funny disappointed face. \"Marvel rules!\"\nEmily slaps my arm lightly. \"Richard also preferred DC, just you know.\"\n\"Aaaaand this is why I didn't get to read free mags,\" I reply matter-of-factly.\n\"Hey!\" Emily laughs, slapping my arm again and her face becoming redder. Then I feel her bright blue eyes examining my face as if she's trying to catch something she didn't see before.\n\"I can't remember seeing you around there too. It would be interesting if we'd met before and then ended up working at the same place!\"\n\"I think so... our friends would say I'd helped you get in there.\"\n\"And how much time you're working there?\"\n\"Uh... 5 years. Almost 6, actually.\"\n\"It's surely a good time,\" she observes, looking at something on the street which had caught her attention, then looking back at me as I keep my eyes on the streets. \"I expect to be able to complete at least one year there. You know, there's s–\"\n\"If you're worried about the recent dismissals, relax. The managers like you, you do a pretty good job; it's unlikely that you would get fired.\"\n\"I hope so...\" she sighs, her smile almost inexistent on her face now as she looks worriedly at her hands, which are resting on her lap.\n\"Hey, Emily... Emily, look at me,\" I try to make her eyes look into mines, and she does it. \"I said: relax. It's okay, they like you. They won't fire a so good employee, they're not retards.\"\nShe laughs when I pronounce 'retards'.\n\"Well... thank you, this is reassuring... thanks.\"\nThis is when we reach the restaurant. Just about fifteen minutes of driving.\n\"Closer than I thought it would be,\" I speak while parking the car.\nOnce I finish parking, she leaves the car and I leave it too. I go to her side so we can enter the place together, but I look at her face... her eyes are sort of uneasy, despite her face showing a smile.\n\"Is everything okay?\"\n\"Yes, you're nicer than I thought!\" she declares. \"Thus I'm gonna ask you again: are you okay with that? With... this place? I'm sorry but I feel impelled to ask you one last time...\"\n\"I can't be more sure of that. Emily, I'm loving your company here. This is what I truly want, that's why we're here.\"\n\"Uh... okay then…\"\nWe go to the entrance of the restaurant and, while we walk, I feel Emily's hand touching mines. I hold her hand, feeling a soft, quick quiver in that hand of hers.\nAt the restaurant entrance, a pretty, very well-dressed waitress smiles at us, nodding while showing us the insides of the place: it's nice but a little less than I was expecting: I did read some mixed reviews on the web while working and most guys wrote that the food here is... ordinary. And a bit pricey. But they enjoyed the first-class reception and services. On the other hand, almost all the girls and women wrote the best things I have ever read about a restaurant, mostly about its unique cuisine. I don't know why, but I didn't see a single guy talking about the live food they serve here. Just females talked about it, but not that much. They just said the experience is always beyond incredible and things like that.\n\"Do you have a reservation, sir?\" the waitress asks.\n\"No... I think I'm gonna just look for a nice table to sit at... do you have any recommendations?\"\n\"Yes, we do. This way, please,\" she guides us toward a place with a nice view of their enormous garden. The air is slightly cold outside, and the cold wind blows gently from a large, open window next to the pointed table. I pull a chair for Emily to sit on and then I sit at the table too.\n\"Would you like to have something to drink? The first drink is free,\" the waitress offers while Emily gets the menu to choose something.\n\"Please, I'd like to have an iced tea,\" Emily says to the waitress, who jots her order in a tiny notepad. \"Why don't you drink the same? Their iced tea tastes great! Trust me,\" Emily speaks to me.\nI'm not into iced teas, but... well, I'm gonna try one. Maybe they can surprise me with their drink. And it's free!\n\"Sure, I'll accept a cup of iced tea too, please. Also, I'm here for the live food. Ca–\"\n\"Live food, uh? What a gentleman,\" the waitress says, looking at Emily with a wider smile. \"We'll be here with the drinks in a minute,\" she turns, swiftly walking toward a door and disappearing after turning right.\n\"You said earlier that you already ate here, as far as I can remember...\"\n\"Yeah. In the last eight months I ate here twice. The usual food they serve here is so... well, ordinary, but the live food is fantastic!\" she grins.\nThen, once more, I see her eyes growing a bit uneasy, but she blinks, gently shaking her head, and again her eyes are just happy.\n\"Did you eat the live food those two times you ate here?\"\n\"No, just the last time. You know... they're pricey!\" Emily giggles, blushing a little.\nAnother one saying that this place's expensive...\n\"I hope my credit card has enough to afford paying a live food then!\" I laugh, then another waitress comes to our table, serving us.\n\"Here, two iced teas,\" she says, placing the drinks on the table and then going to another table. Emily's eyes are fit on me, there's some expectancy in her face and I can't really translate why. A mix of wonder and subtle disquietude.\n\"...what?\" I ask, trying to understand what she wants.\n\"I'm just curious about what you'll think about the iced tea. You don't seem like one that likes iced tea, considering the face you made when asking for it.\"\nGotcha.\n\"Yes, I'm not a fan, but who knows? Let's have a drink!\"\n\"Yeah!\" Emily raises her cup, bringing it to her mouth and taking a sip. Then she licks her lips, enjoying the taste. I take a sip too.\nOh dude!!\n\"Emily! This is... incredible!\" I admit, taking another sip. And then another larger sip.\n\"I told you, it tastes great!\" Emily grins broader, taking another sip too.\n\"What kind of sorcery is this?\" I say, making Emily giggle.\n\"You know what? I... like funny guys...\" Emily blushes. \"I like to have someone to laugh with me.\"\nMy heart starts racing as it never raced in my chest. She just... I mean, that girl, Emily herself... she's enjoying my personality? I can't believe it! I'm almost floating, I don't even know how to reply to her.\n\"Being honest, I'm enjoying it too much too. I just hope they don't take long with the fo–\"\n~~~ * * * * * ~~~\nI wake up.\nI'm still feeling a bit strange. I blacked out… I guess. The last thing I can remember is being at the table, talking with Emily while looking at her face, admiring her eyes... and drinking that superb iced tea. Just thinking about her smile makes my heart beat faster in my chest.\nBut, again, I shake my head, trying to focus on my current situation. Now my senses are all back and I try not to get nervous as I realize I'm tied and gagged, sitting on a hard, cold, smooth surface. Everything's very dark around me but I can sort of see some dark, metallic shades of gray and there are faint sounds of female voices all around, nothing more.\nI slow down my breath, breathing deeply while closing my eyes for a while to control my emotions. Being all nervous won't help me. I must be polite, calm, and I must negotiate. They probably just want my money, my credit card, my phone... I can somehow manage to get out of this situation alive. Better lose my money than lose my life. I'll cooperate and maybe they'll just let me free in some shadowy place, physically unharmed.\nBut... what about Emily? Oh no Emily!! What if they raped her? She's a woman, women have more things to deal with when kidnapped. She's pretty and seems so fragile, I can't help getting worried about her. What if–\nThe surface I'm sitting on trembles and I feel a strong motion sidewards, followed by a sudden stop.\n\"We're sorry for the long wait. Here, we wish you a very nice meal,\" I hear an unknown woman saying.\n\"Thanks.\"\nHey, wait... this was Emily's voice?\nBefore I start shouting, wanting to hear her voice again, something impressive happens: the roof above me is removed whole, and light enters, letting me see everything. My eyes take a little while to get used to so much light, but as they start seeing better, I see that I was under a dome-like, metallic piece. I'm sat on something like a white, gigantic porcelain plate, tied with what seems to be seaweed, and my body is sort of dressed in some strange, overly simple clothing that seems fragile and soluble. Around me, food. Gigantic food. Chopped chicken meat, chopped lettuce leaves, brown rice, something that resembles navy beans with a spicy smell, and a yellow sauce with an interesting, also spicy smell.\nEverything around me is gigantic, I must add. There is a silver fork right beside the plate I'm onto, with a white napkin close to it, a huge glass of something greenish and apparently cold... ah, that's a cup of iced tea. Like the one I was drinking with Emily. I turn to my side to see more and...\nOh dude…!\nIt's Emily.\nNo, she's not on this plate, tied like me. No. She's... she's a giantess now! Emily's sat at the table, looking at the plate I'm onto; her pinkish tongue runs quickly on her lower lip as she gently gets the fork and sticks it into a piece of chopped chicken, lifting it to her already parting lips. I catch a quick glimpse of the reddish insides of her mouth, seeing some of her pearl white teeth, maybe part of her tongue as its tip comes out briefly to taste the portion Emily's shoving in that cave that's her mouth... and then the piece of chopped chicken is inserted inside her mouth. The lips close and soon the fork slides out clean, being placed on the plate as Emily chews, grabbing the cup of iced tea and taking a sip.\nI see a soft lump going down her neck, and she places the cup again on the table. The piece of chopped chicken is gone, now it must be entering her stomach, where it'll face digestion.\n\"Mmmpph,\" I try to say something, staying more calm. I'm not trying to get free, nor I'm writhing. I… I just don't feel scared. I know, this is beyond believable, truly surreal, but to know that it's Emily... it sort of makes me feel calm. Don't ask me why.\nThen it hits me. What's gagging me is seaweed, isn't it?\nAs Emily gets some chopped lettuce with the fork, I begin to bite and chew the seaweed that's gagging me. At my size, the seaweed is thick and strong, but after almost one minute, I manage to tear it and have my mouth free. I look at Emily, and her blue eyes meet mines. She's visibly surprised that I managed to free my mouth of the seaweed.\n\"Look who's the tiny now...\" we speak together. I look a bit surprised at her too, and after some seconds of silence, we start laughing at the coincidence.\n\"Oh... very smart, you...\" she says, her voice a bit too loud, although she's not talking loud. No, she's actually talking a bit lower than usual, as I can deduce.\n\"See? Not just a pretty face!\" I joke, speaking a bit louder so she can better hear me, and she laughs, then takes another sip of iced tea. I look around, realizing I'm not in the same place I was with her before... before all that happened.\n\"Where are we? This doesn't look like the same place I was with you,\"\n\"We are in the same restaurant. But this is a reserved area, where they serve live food.\"\n\"Interesting... well, where's the live food then? I hope it doesn't attack me when it's put on your plate tog–\" I look a bit more seriously at her, stopping talking as it finally hits me, my smile leaving my face for a while. \"I... I guess it's... me?\"\n\"I guess so...\" she says, shoving another piece of chopped chicken into her mouth and chewing, now her eyes showing the same subtle uneasiness they showed when we left my car.\n\"Well... now I understand why you were asking me if I was sure... they serve live people as food.\"\n\"Not just people… they serve men,\" she explains. \"It's usually kept as a secret among us women, but somehow there are words outside about men who came here to have live food with some girl and were never seen again. This is why I asked you if you were sure.\"\n\"I should've known better,\" I sigh, looking at the chopped chicken that's near me. Its smell is delicious…\n\"Well... I'm a bit hungry, if it's not impolite of me to say that,\" I say in a funny way, my smile returning to my face. Emily smiles too, a smile that's a bit confused. \"May I have a bit of... this?\" I point to the chopped chicken.\n\"Uh... eh... sure,\" her voice doesn't hide the confusion she's feeling. \"Have as much as you want. I doubt you'll be eating all that food anyway,\" she laughs softly. I laugh too.\n\"I'm hungry but not that much!\" I reply, realizing that now her eyes look at me with curiosity, not confusion anymore.\n\"Aren't... aren't you scared at all?\" she asks as she grabs a pair of chopsticks, pinching a piece of chopped chicken and bringing it closer to my face.\nI bite the piece, chewing and savoring it. \"Mmmm... they cook very well here, it's tasty! I don't know why they are said to have ordinary food.\"\n\"Look...\" Emily says, staring at me with a strange smile. \"Usually the live food is kept tied, but you don't seem like you're going to flee away. I can't understand…\"\n\"Flee away?\"\nEmily, using the fork and a knife I didn't see there before she grabbed it, cuts the seaweed that was tying me. My arms are now free, so are my legs, and I can finally stand up and move more freely. Then, using the same knife, Emily points around me, and my mind, for the first time since I blacked out, focuses not on Emily or the plate I'm onto, but on what's happening at the other tables. There are just females, from young teens to older women, all of them enjoying their meals. I look better and realize that their meals are quite diverse, but many of them have something in common: live, shrunken men. The men are mostly trying to run away, but are tied like I was. I look at a random woman, who seems to be in her early thirties, as she grabs her tied man with a pair of chopsticks, shoving his protesting body inside her wide open mouth. He's a bit larger than something which would be easily swallowable but the woman tilts her head and, doing some effort, swallows, having then a sip of orange soda. The last thing I saw of the man was a bulge going down her neck, showing that he's gone for good. I wonder if the ladies with no men on their plates did already eat the 'live food' they came for.\n\"Hey... hey... is someone there?\" I hear Emily's voice, and I wake up from my train of thought.\n\"Oh, what?\"\n\"I must confess that your calmness intrigues me…\" she says, her eyes and smile gentle as always.\n\"Look... it's not that I'm... willing, you know. But well, uh... even I can't understand. It's you, you make me feel calmer,\" I try to explain, seeing Emily’s smile growing wider when I tell her that she's the reason I feel calm. \"Anyways, it's better to be devoured by you than by some ugly monster from some Japanese movie, don't you think so? You're way prettier!\" I declare, making a funny face when speaking about ugly Japanese monsters.\n\"I… I'm flattered!\" she grins, poking me with the fork while I bite another portion of chopped chicken.\n\"But now I'm curious about something too: you said before that you had already eaten live food here, didn't you?\"\n\"Uh... yes, and your guess is right: it was a man.\"\n\"And that man invited you to a date and all... like me?\"\n\"Not... not actually like you,\" she frowns a little bit. \"Yes, he invited me to a date, but I didn't like him at all. It was me who chose this place for him to meet me. I was looking towards eating him so he could stop being such a dick as he always was! As far as I know, almost nobody missed him.\"\n\"Wow, you must hate that guy!\"\n\"I used to,\" she smiles again, not gently but sort of vengefully. \"But I can't hate him anymore, I can't hate who doesn't exist. He's now just a bunch of bad memories in my brain and nothing more. I am sure you'll agree with me if I tell you who he was.\"\n\"Wait, did I know him?\"\n\"Do you remember Carl, who worked as the Advertising Manager? My former boss?\"\n\"Yes, I rem– oh goodness! I remember him, he simply disappeared three months ago or so! So it was–\"\n\"Yes, I ate him... and he deserved it,\" she says plainly, licking her lips on purpose while gently patting her belly twice. Little does she know how... sort of turned on I begin to feel now as I watch her huge, slimy tongue running on her lower lip, wetting it in a thin, shiny layer of saliva. I breathe deeply, imagining Emily's belly insides, and how it must have been for Carl to be in her digestive system, being treated like any ordinary food.\n\"Wow, I'd be lying if I said that it didn't impress me,\" I sigh, looking into her blue eyes. \"I'm gonna share Carl's fate, then? Did I do something against yo–\"\n\"No, no, you? You're cute! Okay, when you invited me for a dinner, I was just wanting to go to a dinner and nothing more. But when you told me you wanted to eat live food here... well, I was a bit too shy to suggest another place. Anyway, we weren't close, I didn't know you as I'm getting to know now...\"\n\"So you just went ahead with the idea of eating me?\"\n\"Eh... yes, I'm sorry. As I said, we weren't that close, so eating a random coworker wouldn't make me feel that bad... but now... it's different. I'm really enjoying talking with you... I don't think I'd have accepted your invitation to eat here if I knew you this way, I'd have suggested another place!\"\n\"Okay, I'll consider this a compliment,\" I smile, chewing another mouthful of chopped chicken. This time, I have some lettuce too, and as I bite and begin chewing the lettuce, my mouth starts burning. Burning for real! I swallow the mouthful quickly, feeling my throat and the upper section of my esophagus starting to burn too, as I fan my now wide open mouth and extended tongue with my hands, trying to endure the discomfort that strong spice is causing.\nEmily just laughs, getting the cup of iced tea and pouring some drops on the plate. I crouch, drinking the drops and feeling immediate relief. My mouth and throat are still burning a little, but they feel way better than before.\n\"I like it spicy!\"\n\"I see... maybe this is the secret behind your hotness!\" I say, drinking the remaining drops of iced tea while I see Emily blushing, almost hiding her face behind her hand.\n\"Oh, you...\"\n\"Don't you believe me?\" I ask while she sticks the fork in the last piece of chopped chicken, shoving it in her mouth. \"I loved the photos you took of yourself last Saturday, when you went to the beach. That pink bikini of yours fits your body perfectly!\"\n\"Hey... how you– ...!? Just how!?\" she swallows the half-chewed piece of chicken hurriedly, blushing a bit more and almost laughing in shyness.\n\"This is what happens when you have Instagram: people watch your–\"\n\"You stalker!\" she laughs, her face now redder than ever.\n\"Don't be shy, you're simply beautiful! And I bet most girls around us agree. They're all looking at you at this exact moment.\"\nEmily discreetly looks around, confirming that almost all the females in the place are looking at her. At us, to be more precise. She looks again at me when it hits both of us:\n\"I think they never saw a woman talking so friendly with her meal-to-be...\"\n\"I guess so...\" Emily nods. \"I also think it's the first time they see the meal walking freely on the plate. Well, it's not their fault, this is the first time I see it too and it's happening with me!\"\nI watch as Emily lowers her head, now her face closer to my body as it never was before. Her enchanting blue eyes focused on my eyes, waiting for something to be explained. \"Speak to me, what's the trick? All boys and men get scared to the core when they realize they will be eaten. And you... you're just being gentle, and funny, and lovable... and even confident, something you never were before! I can't understand!\"\n\"Emily, I am afraid. I am scared. I know it'll be unbelievably harsh for me when I'm finally inside your tummy. But... I don't know, you make me feel... good. I feel good when you're close, that's it. Scared inside, yes, but the nice, warm feelings I have towards you are stronger and fear can't control me. Also, remember: I'm not being eaten by some Godzilla-like monster, that would be scary!\"\nShe laughs again, now more freely than ever, and I feel the strong connection that's built between us. Too bad she's gonna eat me, she'd be a great girlfriend if I was normal-sized and not destined to die in her stomach. I see her hand coming closer, her index finger curving a bit and caressing my face. At around 2.5 inches (about 6 centimeters) tall, it's an incredible experience. I look at Emily's face and now she's not hiding anymore the uneasiness she was feeling sometimes.\n\"There's no way you can get out of here alive, I'm sorry... they have means of detecting fleeing tinies. All tinies end up being eaten, that's all. I'm so sor–\"\n\"Don't be sorry! Wasn't it me who chose this place, to begin with?\"\n\"Yes, but you didn't know about the live food being you!\"\nI gently grab and hug her index finger, kissing its tip; the sweet aroma of her perfume is gentle and soft even for a guy my size. Still hugging her finger, I look straight into Emily's huge, captivating eyes.\n\"Okay, I didn't know, but who cares? Do I care? Try to see things this way: I'm not gonna die. I'm just gonna merge into you. We'll become one.\"\n\"Oh my, why didn't I know that side of yours before!?\" she murmurs, sighing a bit sadly.\n\"Emily... no need to be sorry. Relax. And do what you're supposed to do. I know you're done with the normal food. I know... I know it's my turn now.\"\nThis time, I feel a strong chill traveling through every single area of my body: I just said for Emily to eat me. I gave her total permission and encouragement to swallow me like I'm just food. My arms tremble a little bit but I manage to hide this tension behind a smiling face, looking reassuringly to Emily, who's smiling again to me. Smiling uneasily, also somewhat shyly.\n\"Eh... uh... I guess this is a farewell then...\" now it's Emily who almost stutters.\n\"Farewell, Emily. And if this makes you feel better… it was the best night I ever had with a girl in my whole life.\"\n\"This... this is the first time I feel sorry for a tiny,\" she utters, smiling a bit awkwardly, visibly trying to suppress her feelings. \"I'm sorry, I'm gonna eat you.\"\n\"Emily, please remember what I said: no need to be sorry. Really. I'm okay. Trust me,\" I try to comfort her, and she smiles gently. \"But... well, let's do it, you have a place for me inside your beautiful belly, don't you?\"\n\"Well, yes,\" she says, grabbing a pair of chopsticks and picking me up, lifting my body until I'm face-level with her.\n\"Before you eat me, I have two things to ask.\"\n\"Uh...?\"\n\"First: no chewing me, okay?\"\n\"Fine, I... wasn't going to chew you.\"\n\"Second: answer me: was I a good meal?\" I look at her with a funny smile. Emily can't help smiling wider, all the nervousness dissipating from her mind, as far as I can see. A gentle, sweet laugh comes from her partially parted lips. Dude, what a lovely laugh! Even at my size, she's wonderful! Every detail of her huge face before me... the way her eyes narrow just slightly when her smile turns larger… I think they call it perfection.\n\"How can I answer that, I still didn't eat you!\" the reply comes quickly.\nI take a deep breath. I know the talk is ending, she's gonna eat me very soon now.\n\"So... no regrets. Go with it, girl!\" I finish, waiting for her to eat me.\n\"I can give you that: this was by far the best date I ever had! I wish this date could have lasted longer, and continued in my bed…\"\nWhen I thought Emily would just open her mouth wide and shove me inside, I see her puckering her lips and closing her eyes as I come closer...\nAnd then her lips smack my face and upper torso. I'm pressed against them as Emily gives me a full kiss! I am on cloud nine now, I can't even describe how wonderful it is! It's a dream coming true! I start kissing her too, but actually I can only kiss her lower lip as Emily kisses almost my whole upper body. Her kiss is moist, her tongue coming out and touching me sometimes. I'm completely engulfed by the aroma of her kiss… and suddenly her kissing lips part open, and my body is shoved inside a wet, hot cavern that's Emily's mouth. Before I could react, her lips close behind me, confining me in darkness. I feel the chopsticks sliding away, leaving me on a warm, soft surface that's her tongue. I can imagine the chopsticks sliding out of her mouth, all clean after they did the job of placing me inside her wonderful mouth. A mouth that I just kissed.\nI was going to try to get on all fours, but suddenly her tongue shifts and undulates, pushing me against the roof of her mouth. I feel the air more steamy and hot as Emily salivates more, probably because of my taste. Her breath, now hotter than ever, is all around me as she rolls me from one cheek to another, hints of cold air and weak, quick rays of light coming from the outside world as her lips slightly part sometimes. Her breath is still a bit spicy but her saliva doesn't burn my skin like the strong spice on her lettuce burned my tongue before. I'm in utter darkness and it's quickly becoming harder to breathe. There is little air inside Emily's mouth and her tongue is now moving actively, pushing me from one side to another, and the 'clothes' I'm dressed in are soaked and dissolving. There's a lot of spit covering my body and my face and I keep my eyes closed to help me not to get saliva right into them.\nThen a sudden stop. My body is on her tongue, a little bit curled. I feel everything tilting and her tongue shifts and moves in a different way, squeezing me against her hard palate and causing my body to be pushed closer to Emily's throat. In almost no time I feel an unimaginably strong contraction all around me, her throat muscles forcing my body into her gullet. It's pretty uncomfortable to be pushed so tightly, so hard, toward Emily's esophagus, and with another gulp of hers, I slide into a tight, contracting tunnel. I'm not totally inside that tunnel but my body is being actively forced into it. Out of nothing, a cold liquid flows around me, making me slide helplessly into Emily's strong esophagus.\nIced tea.\nEmily takes one sip and that's enough for my body to slide into the long, slimy tunnel that leads to her waiting stomach. I can't believe, she's really eating me! I still don't feel scared, but now I begin to fully understand that this is the end for me. It won't be easy inside Emily's belly, and I wonder how much time I'm gonna endure inside her stomach, being digested alive in her gastric acids.\nAfter being compressed and squeezed down for about four seconds, I feel a tight opening below me letting me enter a larger chamber. It's utterly dark as expected, and as I finally take a breath, my lungs are filled with acidic air, which causes a strange stinging sensation in my chest from inside. It doesn't hurt me that much, but it's a bit hard to breathe, despite having enough air here inside.\nI fall awkwardly into a hot, burning, gooey pool that's a mixture of digestive juices and everything Emily had ingested on our date before swallowing me. Emily's stomach isn't as spacious as I was expecting and all its walls around, above, and under me are moving slowly and continuously, making it hard to keep balance. Feeling my skin already burning, I go to an upper place on her stomach, holding on to the wrinkled stomach walls to keep myself from sliding back into the strong acids below. Yes, the walls are oozing gastric juices, but they're weaker here and my skin just tingles with them.\nA sudden, strong contraction of the stomach walls pushes me back into the burning pool.\n\"Ouuch! Ouch!\" I shout in pain, trying to jump out of it but being kept in there by the stomach movements. I move a bit slower and manage to leave that hot pool, my skin now starting to ache a lot, as if I'm being bathed in boiling water.\nAnd it finally happens: the fear that was under control until now begins to take the lead inside my mind. I start to breathe deeply, fastly, in an almost erratic manner. My eyes are now wide open, but it doesn't help me as the darkness here inside is so strong it's almost palpable. Against my will, my body starts sliding down towards the acidic pool below, helped by some subtle shifts of the wall I am sticking onto.\nAnd then a stronger movement, which seems to be not only the stomach, but Emily herself moving, throws me mercilessly into the burning pool once more.\n\"FUCK FUCK FUCK!!\" I try to make my way out of it as soon as I can! It seems like my skin is more fragile now, as the burning sensation is noticeably stronger: now it's like I'm being put in pure fire. I manage to leave the pool of digesting food and gastric enzymes, but the gooey juices stuck to my skin are still burning me a lot and I clench my teeth, groaning as I try to endure the fiery pain I'm feeling on all my body.\nWhile I'm trying my best in enduring the suffering, I hear strange, rhythmic sounds from above. They're not Emily's heartbeats, which are different, somewhat soothing, a perfect combination of strong and gentle, no: it's different, slower...\nWithout warning, a huge rush of iced tea hits me hard, pushing me out of place and back into the burning pool, with no chance of resistance from me. I try to swim but my body is forced under the fiery pool, which isn't burning that much now that the cold tea flows into it, lessening its effects. Still, it'll be a matter of minutes, if not seconds, before the iced tea gives in to the strong heat of Emily's stomach insides and digestive juices.\nI take the opportunity to get out quickly from the acidic mess before it becomes all-burning again. My body feels relieved, a little at least. I feel burnings on my skin, and when I thought I would be going back to the 'safety' of the upper parts of Emily's stomach, everything shifts and trembles a lot. It's like an earthquake, and I can't grasp the wrinkled stomach walls, sliding back into the pool of semi-digested food. I note that the tremblings are somewhat rhythmic, realizing that it's Emily walking. Her simple act of walking makes my world shake as never. Gurgling and groaning sounds from deep below in her bowels make me aware of my fate.\nI know I can't resist forever and there will be a moment when the stomach will win that battle. Emily's tummy had successfully digested millions of meals and snacks, including Carl. I have no chance against a so efficient system.\n\"Thank you so much, the meal was great!\" I hear Emily's voice above me, sounding a bit different from here inside. \"Sure, maybe another day. ................... Yes, and I need that, I'll have a big day tomorrow! ........... Yes, yes. I wish you a very comfy night too. Be well!\"\nAgain, the strong trembling, which had stopped while Emily was talking with somebody, starts. I'm already feeling the pool I'm into hotter as ever, the burning sensations once more hurting my body, which is pretty weakened by now. I'm gasping, using all the little strength I still have in my mind to endure the pain, whose levels just grow higher and higher. I don't stop trying to get out of this pool, but the trembling is too strong for me to stay out of it, not to mention the stomach walls, which are now contracting, and flexing way more, actively mixing all the food Emily consumed, me included. The iced tea she drank some minutes ago is now just part of the burning chyme in which I'm being painfully bathed, as I try with shouts and yells to get free. Part of me wants to give up, but my mind's strongest and most primal part wants to survive.\nBut there's no surviving inside Emily's belly.\nSuddenly, Emily apparently stops walking. I hear her heartbeats, they're quick and strong, but still soothing. A relaxing sound to hear through this torture, while I splash helplessly, trying to somehow survive being digested.\nWhy in the hell I asked her to not chew me?\nI feel as Emily resumes walking and, don't ask me why, I begin thinking about tomorrow: I was going to have an important meeting with a prospective client. A new project the company is investing heavily in. Well, they'll have to find another one to attend that meeting, as tomorrow I'll be nothing but parts of Emily's body. I'm already nowhere to be seen, deep inside Emily's tummy. For the rest of the world, very soon I'll be just another missing person.\nMy body reaches its limits and I can no longer try to resist, being now afloat, totally at the mercy of Emily's stomach contractions, which force me into the chyme numerous times as the stomach diligently mixes my weakened body with the semi-digested food. Every time I emerge, I cough and take a deep breath, feeling as the stale, vomit-smelling acidic air burns my lungs. I try to focus on hearing the soothing sound of Emily's heartbeats, minding the memories of the best date I had in my life. Emily truly is the one for me. And as far as we are aware, I'm the one for her too.\nToo bad it was too late when we realized it.\nI keep thinking about Emily: her smile, her perfect eyes, her laughs... admirable voice... and while I think, I realize that my mind is growing numb. So this is it. I smile, remembering when I told Emily that I won't be dying, but just becoming one with her. It'll be great! How much it'll take for me to be part of her incredible self?\n~~~ * * * * * ~~~\nIt's warm.\nThere's light, I can feel it, despite my eyes being still closed. I'd like to open them, but the light is too strong. As I move my arms so I can touch my face, I feel some pain, mostly on my skin. It doesn't hurt that much, though. I take a deep breath, feeling my lungs being filled with pure air. They aren't burning anymore and I feel relieved that I'm able to breathe fresh air again.\nI can't quite understand what's going on. I still remember what happened: Emily ate me. Alive. Despite being one of the most attractive and gentle women I ever saw, Emily's insides weren't so welcoming to me. It was harsh, beyond believable.\nBut I'm somehow here, breathing fresh air, feeling a serene breeze flowing... and there's this overly strong light right on my face. I'm lying on a soft, warm surface, and can feel my body still aching a bit, but able to move.\nWhere am I? Is this the so-called afterlife? Will I find the ones I loved that, like me, are now dead?\nI can't help noticing that there's music playing at a very low volume. I think I know this music... I just don't know what's its name...\n\"Ughn...\" I try to open my eyes, again closing them to protect them against the strong, yellowish light that's over me.\n\"Oh gosh... it's you, my brave man! Morning,\" I hear someone talking excitedly to me. I know that voice, it's Emily!\nAgain, I try to open my eyes, partially covering my face with my hands so I can better see under so strong light.\n\"I'm so sorry, the bedside lamp is too much for you? I forgot to turn it off,\" I hear Emily saying, and then also hear some footsteps. After it, the strong light goes away with a click sound.\nAnd I open my eyes.\nThey take a little while to get used to daylight but now it's pretty easier. Moving slowly, as I'm still feeling some pain in my body, I look around, realizing that I'm in a bedroom, laying on a large, white-clothed bed. Looking to my left, from where I hear a sound, I see her.\nEmily. Gigantic as she became since I was shrunk. Her beautiful face looks happy and she's blowing me kisses as she talks something I'm not actually understanding.\n\"What's... happening?\"\n\"You're back, this is what's happening.\"\n\"I... no, it can't be possible. I was being digested. I remember everything.\"\n\"I'm sorry honey, I tried my best. I'm so sorry you had to endure everything, I can't imagine how horrible it's inside of me–\"\n\"No... you're incredible from the inside too.\"\n\"Oh stop...\" I hear her giggling.\n\"What's happening?\" I ask again, now my eyes fully used to ambient light. Emily, who's now sat at my side, is dressed in dark blue pajamas, her hair loose and humid; it seems like she just had a shower. She's smiling at me, her face showing pure happiness, as if the best thing of her life had just happened.\n\"Well, after I... you know, ate you, I finished the iced tea and went home. I couldn't go home right after eating you because they require us to wait twenty minutes so they can be sure the meal is... uh... dead inside our stomachs. But as it's not so uncommon for me to suffer from heartburns because of the strong spices I like, I always have antacids in my purse. I shoved a pill in my mouth without them knowing, right before drinking the iced tea and thus my digestive acids weren't too strong on you. Yo–\"\n\"Weren't too strong on me? Then I wanna never know how it is to be under your acids when they're fully strong! They burned me for real, like fire!\"\n\"Yes, and I'm so sorry!\" she apologizes, her face becoming a bit sad. \"Wh–\"\n\"It's okay... Emily, no need to be sorry. Remember: I accepted it. I sort of asked for it, as far as I can remember. But... how did you get me out of your stomach? Don't tell me I went the full co–\"\n\"No, no,\" she giggles a bit. \"You wouldn't have survived the full trip. Well, when I was finally home, I forced a finger in my throat and threw you back up. You stayed inside my stomach for almost forty minutes, I was so worried! It's four times the time it usually takes for a tiny to die inside a girl's stomach! You came out unconscious and for a moment I thought you were dead,\" she says, tears forming in the corner of her eyes as her smile disappears. Emily wipes these tears away and continues: \"But when I picked your tiny body up, I felt your heart still beating! I carefully cleaned you whole and used some balm to help your skin, it was all injured because of my stomach juices.\"\nI look at my own body: I'm still naked, my skin is all reddened and seems indeed injured in some places.\n\"Uh... thanks, Emily. Th–\"\n\"No, it's me who needs to thank you! I had the best date of my life, my love!\" she interrupts me, bending her body and kissing me gently.\n\"I was going to say the same: I had the best date of my life! Okay, I ended up being eaten, it was unbelievably rough inside your belly... but let's say this experience was also... interesting. It's not every day I can have a ride inside my girlfriend's belly!\"\nEmily's smile grows wider, her eyes pretty happier now.\n\"You called me...\"\n\"...my girlfriend? Yes. And I can assure you, I am a man with the best of luck!\" I slowly go to a sitting position, Emily gently helping me. \"To have you as my girlfriend... a giantess girlfriend... it's beyond wonderful!\"\nI see Emily's face going red. She smiles shyly at me, again kissing my whole face. Then she seems to remember something and giggles.\n\"What's up?\"\n\"You asked me if you were a good meal...\" she talks with some giggles, remembering about yesterday. \"You weren't a good meal... you were the best!\"\n\"Uh... I'm happy I was... enjoyable!\"\n\"Are you feeling fine?\"\n\"Some parts of my body still ache, but I'm reasonably fine, I guess.\"\n\"I think you'll be totally fine in one or two days. Well, I can wait,\" she grins.\n\"...wait?\"\nEmily stands before me, giving some steps backwards and then sensually swaying her hips as she slowly slides the bottom part of her pajamas down her gorgeous legs, dropping it on the floor. Then, she continues with the improvised striptease, sliding the upper part of her pajamas up until it's also dropped on the floor. She ends up dressed only in the pink bikini I told her about yesterday\nAfter that, she slowly, sensually walks towards me and bends again to talk closely to me:\n\"When you're ready, we can have some fun...\" she whispers with lust in her voice and eyes.\n\n~~~ The End ~~~\n\n"],["The shrunken man came in an unassuming metal box, but she could tell from the motion inside that he was already awake. They had said that he would have no idea where he was or what had happened to him, so she would have the privilege of teaching him that he belonged to her now. He would probably try to escape or to rebel, but she had so much control over him that it wouldn’t matter.\nAlready she knew exactly where he was and what he was doing, even with the box closed. A passive sensation that was the same as knowing where her limbs were, and one that she could forget about just as easily. He was crawling around, unable to keep his feet in the unpredictable motion of the box, looking around in the absolute darkness, though still able to see as if there was a dim light. The fact that that was irregular probably didn’t occur to him, but the process that had shrunk him had given him a few gifts, and given her a few powers.\nThe vision even without light was given so that he would see what was happening to him at all times. Even better, his vitals were tied to hers, so she could do literally anything to him and he would not suffer injury. He was functionally immortal, and she had had his pain threshold maximized; she was looking for a toy to humiliate, not to torture.\nTo accomplish that, she had complete control over his movement and size both. She could change his size merely by thinking about it, from microscopic to his full, natural height. She could move his limbs as if they were her own, or even completely lock out his movement if she wanted. The greatest part, though, was that she could share his senses, or give him her own. Effectively, she could trade bodies with him, and still keep full control over both.\nShe refrained from doing that, though. At least for now. She wanted his first realization of his status to be when she opened the box. They said that she could take him back to get his memory wiped, to relive his first discovery of being tiny as many times as she liked, but there was something special about the very first time. She would eventually wipe him, though. She wanted him to keep the fierce energy of denial and resistance, before finally resigning himself to his fate.\nIt hadn’t been cheap, nor was it strictly legal. It was another person, after all, and, even with her income, she had been saving for a long time to afford this. And she could only imagine the consequences if the world realized that Emma Watson had basically bought a sex slave. \n \n Aaron felt his container stop moving, and he finally was able to climb to his feet. He had no idea where he was and no memory of how he had gotten here. His last memory was of falling asleep in his own bed, and he had woken up bare naked to the jostling of the box. The metal under him was warm and the air was stale. He couldn’t see much, but he could tell that something was off. The grain of the metal was too big, the motion of the box too jerky and sudden. Something seemed unnatural and he couldn’t put his finger on it.\nHe stood up and looked down at his body, wondering where his clothes went. Maybe it was the low light, but it felt like he looked better than he was used to; less fat, clearer muscle definition, the farmer’s tan lines were gone, and all of his body hair had been shaven. Maybe it was the lack of hair, but it seemed like his dick was even bigger, too. He grabbed it and found that it definitely did feel bigger in his hand.\nWhat the hell had happened to him? Panic started to grow, and was immediately replaced with fear as the top of the box swept open, flooding the room with light and explaining instantly what had happened to him.\nThe face that stared down at him from above was gigantic. Each of the eyes were larger than his head, the mouth big enough to swallow him whole. It was a woman, and either he was tiny or she was gigantic. He didn’t recognize her at first, but as the two of them stared at each other, Aaron in fear and the woman in satisfaction, it clicked into place.\nThe wispy, auburn hair pulled back in a loose ponytail. Intense, brown eyes with a slightly hungry look to them, and lightly freckled skin. High cheekbones, full lips drawn up in a satisfied smirk, and a slightly pointed jaw. The woman was Emma Watson.\nThe shock of it sent Aaron straight back down to his ass. He was tiny, probably no more than four inches tall, sitting in a box with fucking Emma Watson staring down at him like a piece of food. She saw the stunned look on his face and her grin grew a bit. \n“Hello, there,” she said, her British accent coming through even those two words. Her expression shifted to sympathy, looking down at him like a dog she had accidentally stepped on. “Oh, come on, stand up.”\nMaybe it was the shock, but Aaron felt himself rise, unbidden, to his feet. He had not moved himself, at least not willingly. Had his limbs moved on their own or had he just been too overwhelmed by the impossibility of the situation?\n“There we go, that’s better,” she said, her face brightening. “I’m Emma, your new mistress. I own you now, so you do what I want, you understand?”\nAaron shook his head slowly, unbelieving. Emma’s smile became hungrier and she reached into the box. Her giant hand moved with frightening speed and wrapped around his body before he could react, and she pulled him from the box, lifting him to head level, what seemed like miles above the ground, or, in this case, the bed.\nEmma stood, naked save for a thin pair of lacy black underwear, over an unmade bed in a large room. Lit by sunlight streaming in through a single window, the furniture and decorations, mostly everything white or pink in color, made it seem like it was her own bedroom. It was a bit messy, some clothes on the floor and some hanging off the dresser. Her bra, black like her underwear, was strung over the bed’s headboard. \nShe had a body that deserved to be admired, thin and athletic, with long legs and small, close-hugging breasts, pale skin with light tan marks from a bikini. Her nipples were small and pink, with tiny bumps on the areolae. Her left nipple was slightly larger than the right, but both sat pointing slightly outwards from the center of her breasts.\nBut Aaron was too terrified, too overwhelmed for admiration. His eyes were locked on hers, and she inspected him like a piece of meat. “I own you,” she repeated finally, drawing him close to her face. “You do nothing without my permission, you do exactly as I say, is that clear?”\nAaron tried to open his mouth to protest, or to even ask what was going on, but he found that he couldn’t. Instead, he nodded, and his eyes widened in shock. He was absolutely certain that he had not tried to nod, but his body had moved anyway.\n“That’s right. I can control your every move,” she said. Suddenly, he was her, staring through her eyes, feeling his own terrified body in her fist. “I can control your senses,” she said. He felt her voice as if it came from his own throat, and it was bizarre and terrifying.\nWithout warning, he was back in his own body, struggling helplessly against her fist as it tightened around him. It grew tighter and tighter, to the point where he could no longer draw breath, and she brought her other hand up and squeezed him even tighter between both hands. The pressure was phenomenal, but it never seemed to escalate to pain. Her hands were shaking from the effort, and then she suddenly relaxed.\nAaron took a deep, relieved breath, and Emma continued, “Your vitals are tied to mine. You can’t die, but I can make things very uncomfortable for you if you do not obey me, do you understand?”\nAaron nodded weakly, this time of his own volition. He didn’t know what her threats meant, but he didn’t want to piss her off until he could figure out what to do.\n\"My first job for you,\" she continued, \"Will tell me how useful you are. I spent a lot of money, so you'd better do it right.\"\nThe sudden sensation of motion was dizzying. Faster than he could believe, he was swept downwards across her entire body, until he was at a level with her hips, staring at the line where her panties met the pale skin of her stomach. Her fist twisted sideways a little bit during the motion, and now he was almost parallel with the ground.\nWith her other hand, she pulled open the waistband to her underwear. As close as Aaron was, he could smell the odor that spilled out of them, and, as small as he was, it hit him like a freight train. The heady, fishy smell seemed to displace all the air around him, and he hardly heard Emma speak when she told him, \"You are going to make me come.\"\nHer belly twitched when she spoke, a subtle flexing of her diaphragm that he never would have noticed had he been full size. But, at this scale, at this distance, it was impossible to ignore, showing him exactly how pathetic he was next to the giantess.\nBut he didn't have much time to think about it. With her command, Emma opened her fist, and Aaron tumbled down her spread fingers and directly into the waistband of her panties. The heat multiplied and the odor grew overwhelming as he descended. He bounced once off the springy cotton, struck flesh, and stopped.\nWithout any further prodding or explanation, Emma let the waistband to her underwear snap shut, and his thin supply of fresh air disappeared, leaving him in a world of heat, flesh, and body odor. \nClaustophobia set in immediately, and he began to struggle. The flesh in front of him was solid, and the panties at his back were snug and unyielding. He couldn't gain purchase against anything around him, and his panic grew, making him flail wildly, with absolutely no effect.\n\"You're not gonna do anything up there,\" Emma's voice boomed from above. The skin that pressed against his face shook with the strength of it, twitched with the flexing of her muscles, and he slipped down another inch or so.\nAaron tried to swallow his fear and figure out what he could do. He certainly couldn't escape, but make her come? How the hell was he supposed to do that? He pushed as hard as he could and managed to get enough distance to see that he was within arm's reach of the cleft that led down between her legs. But he knew that the more sensitive flesh was further on, and he'd have to struggle towards the source of that overbearing stench to find it.\nDid he really have to do this? He didn't want to see what would happen if he didn't, so, with a groan, he twisted himself around, working against the pressure of the underwear against his back until he was upside-down, his head level with the cleft. He brought his arms over his head and started to dig into the flesh. His hands met a warm, sticky moisture, and he stopped to look at it. Lubricant. He tried to wipe it off on the dryer skin around him, but it wasn't really coming off.\nDisgusting. But he carried on, seeking with his hands for something that would feel like a clitoris. Eventually, Emma spoke again, \"Are you having trouble finding it? Maybe it would help if it was bigger, then?\"\nWithout warning, or without even a sound to accompany the sudden transition, the entire world around him became larger. The skin underneath him grew closer, the stitching of her underwear seemed to grow more coarse, and the wet groove he was digging his hands through hungrily consumed him all the way to the elbows, multiplying in size before his eyes.\nChrist. She could control his size, too? That would make her the only person who could return him to normal, though. Maybe, if he made her happy, she would let him walk away.\nNo choice but to do what she asked, then. With a noise of disgust, he slowly started pulling himself forward and downward. The pressure of her panties at his back made it hard to keep his head out of the crack, but the skin was growing pinker and wetter as he moved on, so he knew he was going in the right direction.\nHer labia was larger than him now, and by a good amount. Her clitoris might well be the size of his head, and it would be beneath more skin than he could reach by just blindly searching with his arm. He didn't have to stick his face in there, did he?\nBut Emma made the decision for him. Suddenly, there was an immense pressure on his back, through the panties, and his whole body sank between the lips of her labia. The wrinkled flesh parted willingly to accept him, slathering every inch of his body in her fluids, and his face was pressed mercilessly against smooth, bright pink, soaking wet skin.\nThere was no air here, only lubricant. He fought the urge to panic as it filled his mouth and he coughed and sputtered. The thick, almost savory taste filled his mouth, combining with the overpowering fishy odor to create a truly suffocating mixture. But, as he fought to pull his head back enough for a breath of fresh air, he realized that his lungs were not burning for oxygen. Between coughs, he had been breathing comfortably, and it was mostly frothy lubricant that had slid down his throat.\nHe didn't drown, and it didn't even hurt. The realization calmed his panic but made him realize how hopeless his situation was. She controlled everything about him, he couldn't even die down here. He grit his teeth and tried to figure out where she had pushed him.\nHe felt a firm pressure on his stomach, a smooth object that he guessed was her clitoris. He worked his hands down and started to massage it, praying that he was going for the right thing, and waiting desperately for some indication that he was making progress. Even the slightest motion was tremendous down here, though. She spread her legs slightly, and he could feel her muscles moving, her labia shifting around him. Her heartbeat was very clearly audible, and he could feel it through her skin if he focused on it, but it was steady. Was this doing anything for her?\nSuddenly, his whole world shifted violently. The unpredictable sense of motion was nauseating, but he realized from its regularity that she was just walking. Her hips swaying with every step, rocking him back and forth in his panty prison, the impact of her heels hitting the ground vibrating the world around him.\nThen, with a tremendous impact, she crashed onto her bed. His orientation shifted with dizzying speed, and he was hanging upside-down, held tight in place by the combination of her panties and the flesh around him. On her back, she spread her legs wide enough that her labia started to give way, and he just sank deeper into it, all but drowning in her hot flesh.\n\"Well, you tried,\" said her booming voice. \"Let me show you how it's done.\"\nBefore Aaron could realize what she was about to do, Emma's hand dug into her underwear. The casual motion for her was absolute chaos for him. Her slender fingertips immediately filled his entire world, effortlessly moving aside the flesh and cotton walls of his prison. Her middle two fingers pressed against his back, shoving him hard against the flesh of her crotch, which parted and welled up around him.\nThe pressure was tremendous, and then she started masturbating, drawing lazy circles over her crotch with her fingers, and him caught between the two. He slid torturously over lubricant-soaked flesh, every ripple grabbing and twisting at his limbs, fighting in vain against the absolute control of a giantess.\nHe squirmed, kicked, and punched, but he may as well have been not moving at all for all the good it did him. If anything, she seemed to enjoy it more. With his face being ground mercilessly into her flesh, he could hear her heartbeat picking up its pace. Just barely, through the deafening squelching of wet flesh, but it was distinct. Her hips started to rock, but he could barely tell through all the motion, and, if he wasn't mistaken, he thought he heard a soft moan pass her lips. \nBut, God, this was taking forever. It would have been erotic if it had not been so terrifying. The dark wrinkles and wet pink flesh of her crotch ripped over his face in a blur of speed, his entire world replaced with heat, noise, and motion. As time went by, she pushed harder and moved faster, making the exercise more torturous for him with every passing second. \nIt couldn't have been more than a few minutes, but it felt like hours. He could definitely hear her moaning now, moving faster and pressing harder, making the whole thing, if anything, even more painful. Just when it got to the point that he was starting to get used to it, almost even bored of it, she came.\nShe let out a cute, choking gasp, and her hips bucked once or twice, more of a twitch, still holding him facefirst against her pussy. And then she let out a long, relieved sigh, and her hand pulled free of her panties, leaving Aaron still trapped between her sopping wet labia.\n\"Mmm, yeah, that's how you do it,\" she breathed, her soft voice barely reaching him through the flesh around him, the words barely audible over the pounding of her heartbeat. \"You just stay down there for now, see if you can figure it out yourself.\"\nWait, was that it? A few minutes of sexual torture and now he just had to hang out in her still-wet panties all day? Of course he did, it didn't matter to her that he would by lying here in the heat and stink while she went about her day. What if he needed to eat? Or drink? Or sleep?\nHe realized with a growing sense of dread that he probably didn't need to do any of those things. She had just put him through a torture that should have killed him at his size, and lubricant had flowed freely down his throat and into his lungs without him even noticing. He couldn't die, and he couldn't escape, he could only lie there and wait for Emma to want another round.\nShe got off the bed, the motion chaotic and unpredictable, the flesh around him shifting with soft, wet noises as she did so. He finally wound up face-up, his upper body buried so deep in her labia that he was staring at the entrance to her vagina, and his legs below the knee both free, though twisted around each other and pressed up against her flesh by the pressure of her panties. The heat was phenomenal,  making it hard for him to think about anything but how hot it was, and he couldn't tell if he was sweating or just soaked head to toe in lubricant. \nHe rocked back and forth with her hips, unable to move his limbs to seek a more comfortable position for the force of the flesh that surrounded him. With every step, he felt the vibration and heard the soft thump of her heel striking the ground. Her cadence was irregular, but, after a few minutes, the predictable, repetitive rhythm of her every step was something that he thought he could get used to.\nThen, abruptly, he was her. Looking through her eyes, feeling cool air on slender limbs. An unfamiliar pressure on his chest that he realized was her bra. He couldn't control anything, and the realization was a new kind of claustrophobia. Trapped in his mind, or, rather, in someone else's, an audience to her life but unable to so much as blink.\nShe pulled a T-shirt out of a drawer and slid it down over her head, then picked a skirt off the ground and put her legs through it, buttoning it up and straightening out her outfit with mechanical efficiency. She turned and looked at a wall-length mirror, and it still came as a shock, seeing the reflection of Emma Watson through what felt like his own eyes.\nShe grinned and hiked up her skirts, and a single hand went down between her legs, her middle finger sliding gently over her crotch. He couldn't feel anything there except wet cotton, and he realized that he really couldn't feel more than a slight pressure in his... her crotch. She was basically able to ignore that he was even there.\n\"That's you,\" she said delightedly, the voice felt beyond bizarre coming from his own lips. \"Now, don't make me come down there, okay?\"\nThen, just as suddenly as he had been transported into her mind, he was back in his. The assault of heat and pressure and sound and stench was so sudden, and made worse by the few moments he had spent as a regular person, that he yelped and recoiled. Or, at least, he tried. The flesh surrounded him so thoroughly that the shout came out hopelessly muffled and the jump was more of an impotent twitch.\nOh God. Was this his life now? Trapped in this suffocating world while his captor went about her life, completely forgetting about him while every minute spent down here was torture? And what the hell did she mean, come down here? She was going to masturbate with him again, guaranteed, but that threat seemed different.\n","Emma was never really able to forget about the little man in her pants, at least not over the next hour or so. Just walking around outside was erotic, knowing that she had a secret tucked away, that her pussy was someone's whole world right now and the strangers passing her in the street would never know. She knew that the industry, though illegal, still processed a decent number of shrunken men. They might be rare, but Emma found herself looking at faces for a sultry smile that matched her own, wondering of anyone else had the same little toy.\nLess than sixty minutes had passed, and her crotch was still absolutely oozing lubricant, to the point that she was sure that it would start running down her leg, or worse, stain her skirts. She was still slightly tender from before, but already uncontrollably horny. God, this little toy was going to be a liability. If she kept on like this, she'd wind up tackling a total stranger and fucking him right there in the street.\nShe found the first clothing store she could, bought the cheapest set of panties she could find, and immediately retreated to the changing room. Setting her skirt aside, she sat down and looked between her legs at a crotch that was soaked through with lubricant.\nShe closed her eyes, leaned back, and transported her mind into the man's body.\nThe sudden onslaught on her senses was beyond overwhelming. She had no idea how miserable it was for him to be down here. She had planned on masturbating as him for some sexual release, and just trying to forget about him until she got home, but this was too much.\nThe heat, the stench, the pressure. Her mouth was filled with the taste of her own flesh and fluids. Everything she could see was pink and wet, every inch of her skin was enveloped by the soft flesh of her own genitals. Directly in front of her, her vision was filled with the dark maw of her vagina, rippling flesh pressed up tight together, lubricant bubbling up from unknown depths.\nThe moment she realized what it was like down here, she realized what she wanted to do. Fighting against the surprising amount of pressure from the flesh that surrounded her, she forced her way deeper into her own labia, shocked at how difficult it was at this size. She had no problem putting an entire finger knuckle-deep into her vagina, but, at this size, every inch was won with a tremendous amount of effort. \nAnd that's where she was going. She had taken control of her little toy's body and was forcing him to climb into his mistress' vagina. It was exhausting, and she had put her mind so thoroughly into his that she was forced to take a rest every few minutes, gasping with effort, each breath drawing hot, frothy lubricant down her throat. The heat surrounded her and filled her, making the exercise that much more exhausting.\nShe got him in up to his shoulders, both arms over her head, before she was unable to gain any purchase at all. She wasn't able to get her feet down on anything, and her hands slipped uselessly against the soft, fleshy walls of her own vagina. She finally stopped, breathing heavy, and just lay there for a few minutes, sucking down lubricant with every breath. \nThen, holding her senses in his body, she brought control back to her own limbs. She didn't need vision or even touch to guide her hand down into her pants. Feeling her own giant fingers on her back was terrifying, but she used her giantess strength to effortlessly overcome the challenge that had consumed the better part of five minutes. In seconds, she was buried head to toe in her own vagina.\nShe thought about masturbating with his understandably hard dick, but the expression of her absolute control over him she had already made was enough by itself. She'd leave him in here and teach him what else she could do when she got home.\nIn an instant, she transported herself back into her own mind, leaving the little man buried in her vagina. The sudden return of fresh, cool air was a stunning relief, and she leaned back with a grin, patting the still-wet crotch of her panties. A quiet, satisfied 'hmm' came out of her throat, and she took a deep, shaky breath, stood up, and started to change.\n \nThat was the most terrifying thing that had happend to him so far. He had been forced to watch as his limbs moved with a will of their own, dragging him inch by inch into the hole that he had spent the better part of the last hour trying to keep himself from sinking into. It was immediately clear that Emma had come into his mind and taken his body, and, after about five minutes of struggling against flesh like quicksand, she gave up and just pushed him all the way in herself.\nThen his limbs were his again. If he thought that being in her panties had been torture, this was a hundred times worse. Her heartbeat was deafening, and each beat made the walls around him pulse slightly. The only other sound was the wet, squishing sound of her vaginal walls sliding over each other every time he tried to move.\nThe heat was incredible. Soft, elastic flesh sandwiched his entire body, pressing relentlessly against his front and back. He drew deep, desperate breaths, his heartbeat pounding in his ears and claustrophobic panic rising up in his throat. But each breath only served to suck the hot flesh into his face, and all he could draw into his lungs was a thin trickle of frothy lubricant, filling his mouth with the thick taste of her womahhood. \nHe was completely surrounded, and completely at her mercy. The unstimulated walls of her vagina were stronger than he was, so he had no doubt that, if she so much as twitched her pelvic muscles, he would be broken in half. But, if she had taken control of him, that meant that she had been in his mind with him, right? She had seen through his eyes, and knew exactly how miserable this place was for him.\nHe had hoped that she had just not known. That she had just dumped him in her panties and forgotten about him. But that meant that she not only knew, but she had decided to do the one thing that would make it even worse. The last of his hope withered with that realization. \nSo there was nothing for him to do but sit here and wait. Feel the gentle rocking of her hips, listen to the pounding of her heartbeat, and try to endure the oppressive heat and claustrophobic pressure of her flesh pressing against him on all sides. Just lie inside her and wait for her decide to use him again.\n \n"," \nIf anything, what she had done to her little toy had made her even hornier. Within the hour, she could literally feel her vagina throbbing with her heartbeat. She started having fantasies of fucking the first stranger she could find, shrinking the man down to an eighth of an inch and letting him ride it out inside her. God, the idea was appealing, but she reminded herself wearily that she had a boyfriend. No matter how horny she was, it wasn't worth it. That would have to wait until later.\nShe kept fantasizing about it, though, deciding that, when the time did come, she could take up in the little man's mind. Feel the heat and passion of their love from as close as physically possible.\nAfter a while, a thought occurred. This little man was basically her toy, right? It wasn't cheating on her boyfriend to use him any more than it was to use a dildo. She had full control over his size, too, from a fraction of an inch to six feet tall. Meaning that she didn't always have to just use him as a dildo; if she wanted some dick, she could just make him give it to her.\nGod, the very idea made her quiver in anticipation. She could grow him to full size, take control of his brain, and fuck herself senseless. She could even let him experience it through her eyes. Oh, that sounded perfect.\nShe practically ran home, hardly able to wait any longer, and quickly stripped herself naked. Her new underwear had a quickly-growing stain of lubricant in the crotch now too, but she kicked it to the side. She lay down on the bed and dug the tiny man out of her vagina, tossing him down on the floor like the rest of her clothes. Then she closed her eyes and, at the same time, put her mind into his, put his mind into hers (but left out any control over her limbs), and grew him to six feet tall.\nWhen her perspective shifted into his eyes, he was still growing, now about three feet tall. The lubricant that had coated his skin when he was tiny had spread so thin that she couldn't feel it at all. She was naked, a full six feet tall in only a few more seconds, and already hard.\nShe looked down and saw her naked body, seemingly unconscious and sprawled across the bed. With a bit of a shift in focus, she made her own eyes open and meet those that she was looking through now. So there she was, in the body of a man, looming naked over her own limp body, staring at herself with an eager look on both their faces. \nShe knew that her toy was looking back up at her, fully aware of what was about to happen but completely unable to move, even to look away. Which was fine by her; she wanted him to see and feel what it was to be Emma Watson, and what it was to be fucked.\nWithout any delay, she picked up both of her own legs, slid between them, and just started pounding.\n It was, without a doubt, the weirdest, most helpless, and pleasurable sensation he had ever felt. Staring up at himself, feeling a cock stroke rapidly in and out of an organ that he had never had. It felt good, and the pleasure built with every thrust. \nThis was rape, no doubt about it, but how could he tell anyone what had happened, even if he got the chance to? The experience was so bizarre that it was hard for him to enjoy, and, sooner than he would have thought, it was over. With one, final thrust, he felt the cock inside him flex, shooting hot fluid that he could feel with astonishing sensitivity. \nA few more weak thrusts, leaking more cum and spreading it all over her insides, and he pulled out, crashing down on the bed beside him immediately.\nThen he was moving. Emma was back in her own mind. She stood up, and he could feel the cum running down, the warm tingles of a still-raw vagina. She looked down at his body and he saw it rapidly shrinking, already barely a foot tall.\nOh no, God no. But he couldn't do anything as his body finished shrinking, probably no more than four inches tall or so now, and Emma reached down to grab it. \nAs soon as her fist wrapped around his torso, his mind shot back into his own body, and he was staring up at a naked giantess who hardly even had concern enough to look at him as she spread her legs slightly and brought him down between them. He could see the milky white fluid leaking out of her insides. A thin haze coated her entire swollen crotch like a glazed donut, and a single, slimy drop formed on the wrinkled flesh of her labia, threatening to fall at the slightest motion.\nThat was his cum. A thin five milliliters of fluid that, at this size, was gallons of sticky fluid. Emma spread her lips with her free hand, showing the pink flesh and the white stream of fluid that flowed from within it. Then, without delay, she shoved him headfirst into her vagina. \nInstantly, he was once again surrounded in heat and pressure, immersed in sticky, cloudy-white fluid, a mixture of her lubricant and his own cum. He struggled vainly, revulsion rising in his gut, but the walls absorbed all of his best efforts, and he quickly ran himself out of breath. He had tried to stop from breathing the disgusting, viscuous mix of bodily fluids, knowing that he didn't really need air anyway, but his burning lungs would not be denied. He gasped for air, and instead felt the hot fluid sliming its way down his lungs. \nHe choked and coughed, disgusted by the sensation, but he couldn't help but gasp for more, as if it were fresh air he were drawing into his lungs and not gallons of his own cum. Finally, he got himself under control, but there was no use trying to resist it. This was his life now. Heat surrounded him and filled him; he couldn't even close his eyes and pretend it wasn't happening, because the pounding of Emma's heartbeat, the squelching of wet flesh, filled his ears. All he could do was wait and hope that the next time she masturbated would be a chance at fresh air.\n Probably the biggest advantage that men had, Emma thought, was that they didn't need to worry about leakage after sex. She wiped up her crotch and made  sure to put a pad in her underwear, but she'd be oozing the cum, drop by drop, for the rest of the day. The silver lining to all of it was that her little toy would have to spend that whole time swimming in it. She couldn't think of a way to more thoroughly humiliate him than to leave him to stew indefinitely in his own semen. \nDespite the release she had gotten while in his mind, now that she was back in her own, she was feeling a bit sexually frustrated. She thought that she had done well, but she had really only lasted a few minutes. Not like she had had much experience at having sex as a man, but her performance really hadn't been that great. She, as in her own body, hadn't finished. She hadn't even come close. \nThe result was a profoundly dissatisfied feeling. She thought that she could wait until her boyfriend came home, but she really couldn't get her mind of the little man inside her. He wasn't moving enough to be stimulating, just enough that she couldn't really forget about him. She could fix that, but didn't really want to be sucking down lungfuls of cum any more than he did, and, if she wanted to use him to orgasm, she'd have to enter his brain and make him move manually.\nWell, she had gotten this far without a living toy. She crashed on the bed and spread her legs, pulling her panties up to her knees, and started to masturbate.\n \nIf Aaron had been paying attention, he would have noticed that the opening few inches of Emma's vagina started to shift unpredictably. He was too busy being disgusted by the sperm and lubricant sliding down his throat to catch that little detail, though, so the first indication that he had that the giantess was masturbating was a bone-crushing contraction of her pelvic muscles.\nHe was just sitting there, trying to breathe as little as possible, his arms held fast against his body and his legs pressed close together by the already-tight walls of the woman's vagina, when her heartbeat started to pick up pace. Then, without warning, the walls around him turned to steel and clamped down hard on his body.\nThe pressure was incredible. He was already squeezed into as small a volume as possible, but her pelvic muslces threatened to break his bones. The contraction seemed to last forever, though it couldn't have been more than a second or two. Unable even to draw breath amidst the pressure, his eyes felt like they would pop out of their sockets. And then, as suddenly as it had come, it was over. Reflexively, he breathed deep, and realized what he was breathing as the warm slime filled his lungs, and he began coughing uncontrollably.\nBefore he could recover, the giantess' vagina contracted again. The elastic walls snapped in at him from all sides, the gentle textures compressing and grabbing at every limb with brutal force. He let out a gasping scream at the sudden crushing pressure, but it came out as more of a choking gargle as viscuous bodily fluids came flowing from his mouth.\nAgain, the moment the contraction subsided, he couldn't help but breathe deep in his relief, hating himself for doing it. But, even faster than the second, another contraction came, brief but powerful. Then another, and another, and another.\nThrough the torturous cycles of contraction and release, Aaron could hear Emma's heartbeat racing, he could even hear pleasured moans through the tons and tons of flesh that surrounded him. She was masturbating. It probably wasn't that intense for her, but, holy shit; he would give his life to have it end right now.\nBut it didn't end, and he didn't die. He couldn't. He could just lie there, subjected to the cruel force of the giantess' pelvic muscles as she worked her way to orgasm.\nShe probably only lasted a few minutes, but it felt like forever, and he lost track of the number of contractions. He was just barely given enough time to recover from one before another tried to kill him. They came one after the other, reaching a sort of rhythm but each one stronger than the last, until she finally came.\nThat was impossible to miss. Her pelvic muscles clamped down with force like nothing else he had experienced. She had squeezed him with both her fists and it was nothing compared to this. His lungs were forced empty, his eyes felt like they were about to pop out of his head. He fought and pushed with all his might but couldn't even budge a finger. The flesh of her vagina had turned to stone and folded over every curve of his body like latex.\nIt lasted forever, too. He would have been ground to paste if he had been limited by normal physiology. And then, when it subsided seemingly hours later, it was followed by a rapid set of smaller contractions, slapping down on him with barely time to take a breath between, but growing slowly weaker and further apart.\nEventually, it all finally stopped. Her body still throbbed around him, her heartbeat pounding, the walls of her vagina pulsing, the heat so strong that it was a physical presence. But, at the very least, the contractions stopped, leaving him to recover as best he could while surrounded by flesh and fluid.\nBut what next? \n \n","Emma lay naked on the bed, her breathing deep and satisfied, basking in the warm and tingly afterglow. It wasn't really that remarkable a time spent flicking the bean, but something about having the tiny man inside her when she did it, just knowing that he was there... Jesus.\nThat was enough for her, at least until her boyfriend came home. She could just enjoy the feeling of the little man stirring around inside her until then. She thought briefly about going down and seeing what things were like from his perspective, but, after cumming, the idea of swimming in that hot mess of fluids kind of grossed her out. She could only imagine what it was like for him, then, when he didn't even have a choice.\nHer boyfriend got home late, and she didn't rush things. If she started before they went to bed, he would probably go down on her, and might ask the perfectly reasonable question of why there was still cum oozing out of her vagina. So she waited until he had already gone to bed. She stuffed her cum-stained panties in the bottom of the hamper, tossed the pad, and sauntered slowly into bed with him, stark naked. He watched her the whole way, hunger in his eyes, and, when she got under the covers, he immediately grabbed her.\nHe didn't ask, and wouldn't stop unless she told him to. Just before he entered her, she shrank the little man as far down as he could go, around a millimeter in size. She couldn't feel him anymore at that size, but she had the sense that he was still inside her, somewhere near the entrance to her vagina.\nShe couldn't help but smile. That was about to change.\nThe moment she felt his dick enter her, she let out a little gasp. For the first time, instead of just enjoying it, though, she tried to study what he did that made him so good. He went as deep as he could into her, then a few shallow retreats. After a few seconds, her boyfriend had her on her back, one hand clamped on her ass to lift it up, and another on her breast, this thumb rubbing slow circles over her nipple.\nAfter that, she very quickly lost track of what was going on. A very powerful wave of pleasure hit her and she gasped, collapsing back onto the bed. Very quickly, she couldn't focus on anything but the pleasure, each thrust eliciting a soft gasp as she let her boyfriend pound her, riding the wave to orgasm, barely even thinking about the tiny man inside her anymore.\n For Aaron, it was the most terrifying, chaotic ride of his life. He was just biding his time in the tight, fleshy hell, still revulsed at the sensation of the hot, slimy mess of bodily fluids sliding down his throat. Even though most of it had run out in the intervening hours, it was still impossible to escape, and impossible to wipe clear of his skin. Since Emma had last masturbated with him, he had breathed it deeply and drunk it by the gallon, but the very flesh that surrounded him produced fluid seemingly endlessly. \nAnd then he suddenly shrank. It was almost instant and it came with no warning. Suddenly, the thin film of fluid almost completely consumed him, and the ridges and textures of her vagina were bigger than he was. He was stuck in a gap between the ridges, unable to free himself from thick layer of heavy, milky fluid. He shrank so quickly that the walls, which had previously hugged him so tight that he could barely move, seemed cavernously far apart before they sprang back together to fill the void. \nBut he was so small that they didn't crush him. As the wall at his back surged up and the wall in front of him came rushing down, they came in contact but didn't press together. He found himself trapped in a tiny pocket where the ridges of her vagina came together. For the first time in hours, he was actually able to move, but the realization of how small the space he was trapped in was, how small he was, was even more claustrophobic than when he had been her humam dildo.\nHe didn't have much time to contemplate his situation, though. Because, only a second or so after he shrank, something absolutely massive came crashing into him and ground him mercilessly along the inside of her vagina, driving him what felt like a hundred feet in less than a second.\nFor a moment, he thought that she was masturbating again, using a rubber dildo and torturing him by making him ride along, but the moment he came to a stop, he realized the much more horrible reality. The wrinkly, purple flesh that pressed against his face, radiating heat and pounding with its own heartbeat, was an actual cock.\nNo sooner did he realize it did the giant start fucking Emma with brutal speed. Instantly, his world became a whirlwind of motion, heat, and pressure. One moment, he was being ground facefirst into the walls of the giantess' vagina, the head of the giant's penis at his back, the next, he was shoved up against the wall and forced to endure the entire length of the man's dick passing over him until he was picked up by the ridge at the head.\nSometimes he was stuck to the man's cock, sometimes he was stuck to the walls of Emma's vagina. More often, though, he was rolled savagely between the two like a mote of dust between his fingers, limbs tangled together and body bent at impossible angles. At one point, he was slammed against the woman's cervix, watching the cock ram in and out until it came deep enough to pick him back up. At another, he found himself on the man's balls, watching the staggeringly huge cock drive in and out of her vagina. He thought that that's where he would stay, until his balls slapped her ass and he was stuck to the giantess' fluid-soaked labia. The flesh around him shook and bent with each thrust, drawing him closer to the vaginal opening, until the giant's penis snagged his leg and dragged him helplessly back inside her.\nHe had no idea how long they were going for, and he could hardly tell the difference between an inward and an outward thrust half the time. He could sometimes tell whether he was trapped underneath the hard, unyielding body of his cock or the softer flesh at the head, but, most of the time, there was too much motion to notice even that. The sound of fluid and flesh sliding and slapping together was deafening, and, underneath it all, he could hear both their heartbeats beating their own rapid, conflicting rhythms.\nThe man finished halfway through an inward thrust. The head of his cock came crashing through the walls, pushing them apart effortlessly, and let loose with a deluge of thick, white sperm just as it passed over him. He was soaked instantly,  but barely had time to realize it before he was shoved into the vaginal walls by the massive, throbbing body.\nThe giant stopped thrusting when he was all the way inside her, his penis flexing directly into Aaron's face as it pushed out the last few drops of cum, then he slowly pulled out.\nAaron realized what was about to happen and tried desperately to stay inside Emma as the cock started to pull him out, but there was nothing that he could do. As the rapidly-softening body slid outwards, he was rolled between it and the walls of the woman's vagina, slowly approaching the entrance, until the mushroom ridge of his glans caught him, and he was dragged helplessly out of Emma's vagina.\nThe man's foreskin folded over him just before he reached the open air, trapping him in a prison of flesh, what little space there was filled by the fluids that he had dragged out with him.\nThis was bad, he realized. He couldn't get the giant's attention, not at this size, and he certainly couldn't escape. He was trapped here for good, at least until the next time he had sex, or, worse, if he took a shower and cleaned under his foreskin. He would be washed down the drain without a second thought, carried away as sewage.\nWhat would happen then? Carried to the ocean and eaten by a fish? He was immortal, but completely helpless. Emma would forget about him like a lost toy and he would live forever as fish food. The very idea was horrific; at least, under Emma's control, he stood a chance of being restored to normal someday, even if it took her whole life. But this stranger had no idea he was here and would likely flush him down the drain without ever even knowing.\nFear overcame his disgust, and he thrashed wildly, his limbs moving sluggishly through the thick, pasty fluid. He pounded at the flesh around him, but, however soft it may have been, it was unyielding to someone of his size. He may as well have been punching a brick wall. He quickly tired himself out and he just lay there, sucking down the thick fluid as if it was air, his mind racing for a way to escape.\nThere was nothing he could do. God, did she even know he was here?\n","The next morning, Emma woke her boyfriend with a blowjob. After they had finished last night, it took her a few minutes to come to her senses, and, by that time, she realized that her little toy was no longer inside her. She knew that he was nearby, but she couldn't really tell where. Once her boyfriend got up to use the bathroom and she felt the toy quickly receding, she realized where he was.\nIt was only the next morning that she realized how big of a bullet she had dodged. The moment she wrapped her mouth around her boyfriend's dick, she sensed the tiny man trapped underneath his foreskin, right under the head of his penis. If he had been anywhere else, her boyfriend might have flushed him down the toilet without a second thought. She wondered idly if it was an accident or he had managed to hide himself under there on purpose.\nDidn't matter now, though. Now it was time to get him back. Her boyfriend was fully erect by the time he actually woke up, and Emma had been able to retrieve the little man from under his foreskin with her tongue. Now, with him planted firmly between her tongue and her boyfriend's cock, she started to bob her head up and down.\nShe was incredibly turned on by the idea of what she was putting the shrunken man through, and apparently her boyfriend, even the morning after, was pretty excited too. He came in only a few minutes, and she took all of his cum in her mouth, sucking on his dick and drawing the little man to the back of her throat. She grinned, then swallowed.\nShe lay back down on the bed, swallowing a few more times to ensure that the little man was in her stomach, then slowly started to grow him. She increased his size until she could feel her stomach getting full, and stopped. At that size, her body wouldn't pass him, and he would just hang out in her stomach until she felt like bringing him back up.\nAfter a while, her boyfriend left for work, and she decided it was time to recover the little man. She drank a little bit of water, shrunk him down again, and shoved her fingers down the back of her throat. \nIt was not lost on her how close she had come to losing the tiny man. Best-case scenario, he would have been lost down the drain and she'd be out of a lot of money; you couldn't exactly insure an illegal slave against loss or theft. Worse, her boyfriend could have found him. She liked him, but she didn't trust him not to sell her out for a crime like that. She didn't know if there was anyone in her life she could trust that much.\nShe looked down at the little man, sizing him up a little bit to see him clearer. He was sitting in the sink in a shallow pool of vomit, trying to clear a thin, slimy film of fluid from his eyes. Not a pretty sight, but he looked better than he deserved, given what he had gone through. If there was anyone she could trust, it would be him.\nNot now, sure. Now, he'd run at the first chance. He probably longed to get washed down the drain, just for the slim chance of escape it offered. But she could break him, or so she was told. He was intimate with her in a way that nobody could ever be, and he would never have a break from the heat of her flesh or the whims of her drive. For now, even the most routine things for her were torture for him, but, after a while, he would get used to them. And, in time, he would long for her attention, and strive endlessly to make her happy. \nThat was an enticing thought. Instead of going back and resetting his memories to give her a fresh new slave, she could go out with him into the world, confident that he would never betray her. She could tell the world that he was her boyfriend, and then she could retreat to her bedroom and use him relentlessly. \nShe turned on the faucet to rinse him off, giggling as the sudden torrent of water knocked him down on his ass. She turned it off before it got warm, and scooped him up. \"Did you have fun last night?\" she asked him, holding him at head height. He didn't meet her eye, his expression fearful and his gaze darting around, trying to take in a world so much larger than he was. \"Hey, look at me,\" she commanded sharply. He cringed, but he did muster up the courage to make eye contact. \"I asked you a question. Did you have fun last night?\"\nThe shrunken man's expression was half fear, half disbelief. After a moment, he shook his head. His voice was small, but Emma could barely hear him whisper, \"No.\"\n\"Aw, I'm sorry to hear that,\" she said, affecting a look of genuine concern. \"Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?\"\nAnother pause. He didn't understand what she was up to, but he clearly didn't trust her. \"You could let me go,\" he offered softly.\nEmma laughed cheerily, throwing her head back and pressing the tiny man to her breast. \"I can't do that, silly,\" she answered, looking down at him again. \"I paid a lot of money for you.\" She made a show of thinking for a moment, then said, \"I'll tell you what I can do.\"\nShe spun on her heel, walking back to the bedroom, trying to keep him steady at head height. \"I own you now, and that's never going to change. But I don't see a reason why we can't both enjoy this. You just have to prove to me that you deserve it.\"\nShe put him gently down on her bed, the bedsheets still unmade and the room still carrying the musky smell of sex. Then, without preamble or explanation, she grew him to his full size. The look of shock was clear on his face, and she could see the indecision behind his eyes. Should he try to make a break for it? Maybe swing a punch at her? Call for help?\nShe swung her legs over his and pressed up close to his chest, wrapping her arms around his warm, firm body. Her thin pajama shirt was the only layer between them, and her firm nipples pressed against him through the fabric. \"Take me,\" she breathed into his ear. \"Show me what you can do.\"\nHe was still a bit indecisive, but she could feel him getting hard beneath her crotch. She ground on him a little bit, smearing him with panties still damp from the fluids of the night before. \"Don't just be my toy, be my lover.\"\nEventually, he siezed on the opportunity like she hoped he would. He grabbed her head violently and pushed their lips together. Their tongues wormed together, and Emma let her eyes close, breathing deep of the smell and heat of him, her hips beginning to rock.\nAfter a few minutes, Emma could feel that he was painfully hard. One of his hands worked its way up her shirt, gripping her breast, and she gasped around his tongue. The other hand was down between her legs before she realized it, sliding into the waistband of her panties and across the smooth flesh of her vulva. \nHe dipped his middle two fingers inside her, and her gasp was half a moan. Her vagina was still raw from the night before, still wet with fluids that she had never cleaned up. He drew his fingers out and brought them up to her face, sliding his wet fingertips into her mouth. She licked up the warm fluid, gazing at him lustfully and willing him to continue.\nHe didn't disappoint. He didn't even bother trying to take her panties off. He just slid the crotch to one side and, with only a glance downwards to align himself, pushed his cock slowly inside her.\n\"Mmmn,\" she breathed, grabbing his head and pulling his lips back to hers. She could barely breathe fast enough through her nose, sucking in the scent hungrily as he slowly started to thrust. She wrapped her legs around his back, and he responded by clamping both hands on her ass and lifting her bodily into the air.\nHer eyes widened in surprise, his cock deep in her pussy, then he jumped down onto the bed, landing directly on top of her while still inside her.\nIt drove the wind from her lungs, and she parted lips to let out a giggly laugh. What the fuck was that? Did he just bodyslam her? Who does that?\nThe laugh quickly turned into a moan, though, as he kept going. He would thrust once or twice, pull his cock out and slide it up and down her labia, tickling her clitoris, then shove it back inside her. She loved it, and the pleasure kept building when he stopped pulling out and instead started to massage her clit with his thumb, leaving his other hand fondling at her breast.\nShe came in about five minutes, and she was obvious about it, letting out a pleasured gasp, fighting for air as ecstasy tightened her entire body. A few thrusts later, he pulled out, and, with a breathy grunt, ejaculated onto the sheets between her legs.\nWhen she finally came down, breathing hard and sweating, she looked down with disgust at the stain on her bed. \"What is that?\" she demanded. \"Are you trying to leave evidence behind? You don't want to sit in a vagina full of your own cum, is that it?\"\nShe rolled her eyes and froze his motion, and he collapsed on top of her. With a groan of effort, God he was heavy, she pushed him off her and stood up, straightening her shirt and her panties. \"Now I have to wash my sheets,\" she said. \"I told you, I own you, and nobody is going to 'rescue' you.\" She let out a shaky, satisifed sigh. \"You know, for a moment, I thought you were enjoying yourself.\"\nShe turned away, stopped, then went back and gave him a gentle kiss on the lips. \"That was fun, though,\" she told him quietly. \"We should do this again sometime.\"\n","Aaron lay there, unable to move, listening to the shower run, trying to figure out what had just happened.\nLess than twelve hours ago, he had been mired in flesh and fluid, stuck beneath the foreskin of a man a thousand times his size. He had been trapped, helpless, as Emma sucked him off and swallowed him whole with a mouthful of cum. He had lay in the terrifying pit of her stomach, the walls beating at him from all sides, until it had suddenly seized and shoved him up through her throat and into the sink.\nAnd the payoff for all that was getting laid? Emma seemed like a completely different person than she had the day before, if anything because he wasn't currently shoved bodily into her vagina. He could scarcely believe that she would treat him any differently, but he siezed the opportunity. If pleasing her was his ticket to freedom, then he would work his ass off for it.\nHe could have done better if he had jacked off beforehand, but at least she finished first. He had pulled out because, in all honesty, he didn't think that women enjoyed men finishing in them. But it seemed to piss her off, and now she thought that he was trying to find a clever escape.\nOr was it a trap the whole time? Would she have found a reason to get mad at him no matter what he did? Then again, her boyfriend had finished inside her yesterday, and she had left it stewing inside her all night, which was honestly kind of disgusting. Maybe she wanted it. Next time, then.\nIf there would even be a next time. He had blown his chance. He'd spend the rest of his life inside her, he knew it. At least he could say that he had fucked Emma Watson.\nThe shower cut off, and, a moment later, he heard her walk out of the bathroom, followed by a wave of steamy air washing over his naked body. He couldn't see her, he just stared blankly at the ceiling, waiting to see what she would do next.\n\"You could probably give my boyfriend some pointers,\" she mused. \"He's good, but that was... whooh. And I've been building you up all day.\"\nShe paused, then her face was over his. She was naked from the waist up, a bra in her hand as she leaned over him with a suspicious look. \"Wait, you didn't jerk off in my stomach, did you?\"\nShe eyed him for a moment, then laughed and pulled away. \"Now, that's the kind of behavior I want from you. I want you to love every part of my body. I want to make you stop trying to pleasure me. You're not there yet, but you will be.\"\nShe was quiet for a moment, and he listened to the sounds of her getting ready before she announced, \"You are terrible at conversation, by the way.\"\nReally? Then let me talk, you bitch, he thought. But he couldn't say anything. Couldn't move but to blink. After a while, she said, \"Alright, time to go. You want to come with?\"\nIn an instant, he shrank down to less than an inch, lying frozen in a seemingly endless field of bedsheets. He had an idea of how small he was, because he was frustratingly close to the stain that he had left on the bed. Emma picked him up between thumb and forefinger and looked him down curiously. \"Where do you want to go?\" she pondered. \"I guess it doesn't matter, does it?\"\nShe had a thin dress sock in her other hand, and he was able to see that she had a lookalike on her left foot. \"For the record,\" she said, \"I was going to clean myself up before putting you back inside me, but this seems better for now.\"\nThen she dropped him into the sock. He struck the fabric three times and bounced off before he hit the bottom, and he could barely see the outside world through the sheer cloth. With a sudden, lurching motion, she sat down on the bed, and he was tossed around helplessly inside a sock that waggled free in the air. Then she lifted her foot and slid her sock onto it.\nThe sound of fabric against her skin was deafening, the pale underside of her foot screaming at him with incredible speed. He was struck by the soft flesh of the arch, and his face was pressed mercilessly into it as her sock drew tight. For what it was worth, the skin was smooth, and smelled of soap and moisturizer. Maybe this wouldn't be so unpleasant.\nWhen she put on her shoe, he was pressed a little harder into the flesh, but nothing could have prepared him for when she put her foot down.\nHe had hoped that the softer flesh of the arch of her foot would shelter him, he had hoped that less of her weight would be concentrated here, but the moment her foot hit the ground, the pressure that beset him was immense. He should have popped like a grape, his bones should have been ground to powder instantly, leaving nothing but a modest bloodstain on her foot. But, somehow, he survived, under pressure greater than anything he had ever felt before. He could hear his blood pounding in his ears, his chest pushed down so hard that he was sure his sternum would touch his spine. \nThe pressure subsided for a moment, and he drew a ragged breath, heavy with the scent and taste of her foot, before her foot came back down and tried to kill him again.\nOh God. She was just walking. This was torture beyond what he could have ever imagined. He would rather spend the entire day swimming in his own cum, he would rather be shoved facefirst up her asshole, than take another step under the sole of her foot.\nBut, as she said, it didn't matter what he wanted. \nHer foot came down with a deafening bang each time, and he took a deep, desperate breath when her weight lifted before it came back down and drove the air from his lungs. Gasp. Wham. Gasp. Wham. Gasp. Wham.\nThe rhythm was constant, at least. Painful, but reliable. After a few painful minutes, she stopped, her weight balanced equally on both feet. Maybe waiting for a bus, maybe a crosswalk, maybe just checking her phone. He couldn't tell because all he could see was the sole of her foot, and all he could hear was the pounding of his own heartbeat. Even half her weight was enough that he couldn't fill his lungs, and he lay there, trying in vain to struggle free with his lungs screaming for release.\nHe didn't need air, he knew it from the hours and hours he had spent swimming in bodily fluids. What kind of cruelty was this that his body demanded to breathe even when it didn't need to? Begging for reprieve, he squirmed and pushed and kicked but, with the giantess' weight on top of him, he couldn't move a muscle. He didn't even have the air to scream, though he was sure that nobody would even hear the muffled cries through the infinite flesh that surrounded him.\nThen her weight shifted, and he was finally able to give his lungs the relief they wanted. He greedily sucked down hot air, heavy with the stench of soap and moisturizer, for the brief moment before her weight shifted back and pushed the air out of his lungs again. \nAll Aaron wanted was to die, and it had hardly been fifteen minutes. But he couldn't die, and he knew that he would probably be stuck here for the entire day. God, this was a nightmare.\n","At first, Emma was careful to make things as torturous as possible for her little toy, resting her weight against her right foot as often as possible, feeling for his desperate, panicked twitching. There was some, but either he was too small or she had broken him entirely, because there was not enough for her tastes. Eventually, she got bored.\nHaving the little man in her panties had added an erotic thrill to her routine, so much so that she couldn't trust herself to do it again. But this was nothing like that. She knew that he was under her foot, but he didn't feel any different than a rock stuck in her shoe.\nShe had an interview at a studio downtown, and, while sitting in the back of the cab, she transferred her mind into his. Immediately, she was assaulted by an incredible heat, odor, and, above all, pressure. Pressure so great that she couldn't move, so great that she couldn't breathe, even as her lungs screamed for air. It was so horrible that she immediately retreated back to her own mind, gasping for air despite herself.\nWell, that was one hell of a way to torture her toy, but what was the point of torture if she didn't get anything from it? Fine, she had found a way to punish the little man for crossing her, but it wasn't doing anything now. He hadn't really done anything wrong. Sure, she made him think that he had fucked up by staining her bedsheets, but this was way overkill. A punishment this cruel had to be saved for when he actually pissed her off.\nShe couldn't move him, not now, but she let him into her mind as a reprieve from the torture of being under her foot. At least now he wouldn't suffer under the endless, suffocating pressure.\n\"Feel that?\" she muttered to herself, crossing her right leg over her left and wiggling her toes. \"That's you. Almost can't tell you're there, really.\"\nShe was silent for the rest of the cab ride, texting her boyfriend on her phone and not caring that her tiny toy was reading the occasionally naughty messages. Eventually, the cab arrived, and she stepped out, taking care to slam her foot down as hard as she dared in heels. \"Ooh, I bet that hurt,\" she whispered to herself.\nAfter that, though, she scurried to the bathroom as fast as she could and sat down on the toilet, peeling off the shoe and sock that the tiny man was stuck in. He came off with the sock, and she had to dig into it to pull him out, then lifted his tiny, limp body in front of her face. Not a single sign of damage. Of course. That's what she paid for, but it was impressive nonetheless.\n\"You see how tiny you are?\" she asked aloud. Her toy could see his own body through her eyes, and she wanted to take the opportunity to drive her point home before she carried on with her day. \"You could be a pebble in my shoe for the rest of your life, and it would make no difference to me.\"\nWith that, she put him back into his own mind. She watched his glazed, unfocused eyes gain awareness, and his tiny face suddenly shift to shock and fear. \"I own you,\" she told him softly, almost lovingly. \"And the sooner you realize that, the more fun you'll have.\"\nShe dropped him into her other palm and closed her fist. Immediately, she felt him start to squirm, and she tightened her grip, \"Ah, ah, ah. Stop squirming.\"\nHe stopped moving, though it took a second. When he did, she stood up, slid down her skirt and panties, and back sat down on the toilet to take a piss. She placed the tiny man tenderly on her left thigh and opened her fist. At barely an inch tall, he couldn't get very far if he tried to escape, but she wanted to see what he would do.\n \n \nEmma Watson opened her fist, and the sudden flood of light and fresh air was overwhelming. Aaron stood on uncertain footing about midway up her left thigh, his tiny body barely even heavy enough to put a dent in the naked flesh.\nHe stared up at a giantess naked from the waist down, sitting on a toilet and looking down at him with an almost bored expression. He was paralyzed with both fear and confusion for a moment, then he heard the unmistakable sound of her peeing. \nHe looked down in shock, as the acrid odor of urine wafted up and mixed with the heady, fishy stench of her pussy. When he looked back up, her expression hadn't changed and her gaze hadn't broken.\nSomehow, this kind of intimacy was so much more shocking than anything he had seen so far. He had no idea what to do. The thought of running crossed his mind, but he was barely an inch tall and she had absolute control over his body. If he even made it as far as her knee, it would only be because she wanted it. \nEverything he thought about doing, every escape route he could dream of, came to the same final disappointing conclusion. She had full control over everything about him. If he tried anything that displeased her, she would shut it down immediately, and probably punish him on top of that. The realization hit him like a physical weight, and he collapsed backwards, falling on his naked ass onto the springy flesh of Emma's thigh.\nHe saw a grin start to cross her face, and he lowered his gaze, not wanting to watch her realization that she had broken him. After a minute, her pee slowly trickled to a stop, and she finally spoke. \"I'm proud of you, little guy. I thought you were going to try and make a run for it. As a reward, you get to spend the rest of the day with me.\"\nThen, instantly, he was behind her eyes, staring as she plucked him off her thigh with one hand. With the other, she grabbed a wad of toilet paper, wiped herself with a quick, mechanical motion, and then stuck his shrunken body knuckle-deep into her vagina. He felt the sudden tingle of pleasure at the act of insertion, but, when she pulled her finger away, he couldn't even feel the weight of his own body inside her. He knew without a doubt that it would have been an unending, awful experience if he had been inside his own mind, and the thought that Emma could have gone about her day without even thinking about the torture she was putting him through was crushing.\nBut now he was trapped behind the mind of another human being. Unable to move, even to breathe or blink at will, but a helpless passenger to another's experience. The unbelievable part was that it was still somehow better than the alternative.\n \n \nEmma did her interview, and, with nothing else for the day, went home and fucked around on the Internet for a bit. She debated spending all her time sexually torturing her new toy, but building the kind of trust she wanted from him meant being honest. She wasn't fucking or masturbating in every free minute; she could go days without even thinking about sex, and being a part of that mundane routine, even if it was from the inside of her vagina, was something that her toy had to get used to. More importantly, it was a form of intimacy that she thought was more meaningful, if less shocking, than sex.\nBut, later that evening, she was already starting to get drunk off wine by the time her boyfriend came home. He rapidly caught up to her, and, after an hour of Netflix, she had his pants unbuckled and her mouth around his dick, and his fingers were already in her pants. \nThrough the warm haze of the wine, she just barely had the presence of mind to shrink her little toy down to minimum size before she felt her boyfriend's middle two fingers slide down her crotch and into her vagina. He pushed his fingers inside her, and she gasped contentedly around his cock, her eyes rolling back into her her head.\nHe explored her insides for a few moments with his fingers, then drew out. His free hand grabbed her hair and yanked her, with a surprised gasp, off his dick. They shared a gaze for a moment, then he slid his still-wet fingers into her mouth.\nEmma didn't break eye contact, just drunk enough to enjoy the thick, savory taste of her own fluids. She sucked his fingers clean, but didn't recognize until she swallowed that her shrunken toy had been clinging to her boyfriend's fingers as well. Her eyes widened, lips still wrapped around her man's fingers, as she came to the sobering realization that the faint presence of the little man was no longer safely tucked away in her vagina, but was now resting in the pit of her stomach.\nOh well, she thought. He'd survive, and she could get him in the morning. Then, as if he had somehow heard her resign the microscopic man to a tour of her intestines, her boyfriend picked her up and slammed her down on the couch, sliding up between her legs and pushing his dick effortlessly inside her.\nAfter that, she really couldn't say what happened.\n","Maybe it was a side-effect of the alcohol, maybe it was a conscious decision, but, as soon as Emma started to get a bit drunk, Aaron was forced back into his own mind. The sudden sensation of overwhelming heat and bone-crushing pressure, all-encompassing stench and a slimy taste that filled his mouth was an overwhelming assault on his senses. He kicked and squirmed, off pure instinct, but his fighting elicited no reaction.\nThen, a few minutes later, he suddenly shrank. He knew immediately what was coming next, or he thought he did. But, instead of her boyfriend's cock slamming through the walls, his fingers did. They worked their way effortlessly into her vagina, and he found himself pressed betweeen the muscled walls and his middle fingertip.\nThen he pulled his fingers out, taking him along with. Aaron was pulled out of Emma's vagina and into blinding light, still clinging to her lover's fingertips in a thick layer of vaginal fluid. After a dizzying blur of motion, the next thing he saw was Emma's mouth opening wide to receive him.\nOh, God dammit. In a second, her lips closed around the man's fingers, plunging him back in darkness. Her tongue, bright red from the wine, slimed up to lick him off. Wine-laced saliva mixed with vaginal lubricant, and her tongue worked him towards the back of her throat. Then, without warning, her throat closed tight around him and dragged him down into her belly.\nThe whole process only took a few seconds, and he spent most of it in the tight, pulsing confines of her esophagus as the powerful muscles pushed him rapidly down. He hit her stomach with a wet slap, and was immediately thrown into the air by the sudden motion of walls that pulsed like the waves of the ocean. \nThe constant motion was nauseating, and, ironically, he had to fight to keep from throwing up. The walls of her stomach twitched and heaved ceaselessly, throwing droplets of brown-grey fluid around. Sometimes, Aaron would hit the wrinkles her stomach and ride the heaving muscles, stuck there by gravity and the viscous fluids that lined the walls. Other times, he was thrown into the air, either by the giantess' sudden motions or the convulsions of her stomach, and bounced off of one fleshy surface after another.\nHe was coated head to toe in stomach acid. He knew from the subtle tingling on his skin, even though it did no damage to him. He knew that the acid, combined with the pummeling of her stomach, should have reduced him to a pile of liquified flesh and half-digested bones, but he survived anyway. After about an hour of enduring the endless abuse of her insides, he found himself at the bottom of her stomach in a thick pool of half-digested fluid. Then the tight opening below him parted, and he was sucked down into the slow, steady path through miles and miles of intestines.\nHe had hoped, even as Emma's stomach pounded at his helpless body, that she would size him up, prevent him from passing any further, and throw him up when she was done. He held onto that fading hope even as he slid towards the muscular ring at the bottom of her stomach. But the moment that that ring dilated, and he slid into the fluid and flesh-filled hell of her intestines, all hope was lost.\nHow long did it take for food to travel through the human body? A day? Two? Maybe it would be even longer for him, his tiny body stubbornly remaining whole amidst the sloshing fluids. He would have thought that her body would barely even notice him at this size, but her intestines continued to suck and squeeze at him, mindless muscle seeking to abosrb whatever it could from him. Thick fluid, rich with the sour taste of half-digested food, filled his mouth as he screamed futilely. Emma's heartbeat pounded its steady, powerful background beat as the msucles of her intestinal tract patiently pushed him further and further into her body. Aaron's fighting spirit wore itself out after the first few hours, but, even as he lay still, feeling the gentle but insistent pulsing of her body, he knew that there was much more left to go. \nAnd, worst of all, he would live to experience every moment of it.\n Emma waited for her little toy to emerge again, cursing her drunken self for swallowing him. Her vague sense of his location wasn't specific enough to tell exactly how far along he was, only that he was still inside her. So every trip to the bathroom was an exercise in false hope.\nHer frustration grew with every passing day, along with a nagging fear that she had fucked up by swallowing him at that size. What if her intenstines had been able to absorb him? What if her body had used his tiny body as food and deposited him somewhere inextricable? There'd be no way for her to tell if he was still sliding through her intestines or if he had been trapped in a globule of fat somewhere around her stomach. She tried to shift her mind into his to check up on his progress, but everything was red, hot, and filled with fluid. She couldn't tell what part of her body he was in from that perspective. She wanted to size him up to help find out where he was, but she didn't want to risk injuring herself.\nOn the morning after day seven, Emma finally felt her shrunken toy leave her body. Half with relief, half with disgust, she recovered the tiny man, sizing him up to twelve inches to aid in cleaning him off. Fortunately, the filth didn't size up with him, so there was actually very little to clean.\nWhen he was clean, Emma set him on the side of the sink so she could wash her own hands. She had debated a lot whether to own her mistake or make it seem like it was something she had done on purpose. If she wanted a healthy, trusting relationship with her little living toy, she had to be honest with him. He would, he already had, seen parts of her that no other man ever could, so how could she be reserved about sharing her mistakes?\nOn the other hand, her relationship with him wasn't a romantic one between equals. He was, for all intents and purposes, her slave. She wanted him to want to be her slave, but he was still her slave. His mistress had to be infallible, she had to own everything about him and do everything with a purpose in mind.\nShe eventually decided to make it seem deliberate, mostly because this had been the majority of his time with her. After the first night spent in her stomach, she moved him to her mind, rather than making him endure the torture of being digested for however long it was going to take. She only put him back in his own mind once or twice a day for an hour at a time, just so that he knew exactly what was happening to him, in case she needed to use this as a punishment later.\nShe never bothered explaining herself to him, and she knew that he was begging to know the answer. But now that his little whole-body tour was over, he stood naked beside the sink, looking up at her expectantly and asking the question without even voicing it. Alright, she thought, flicking off the water with a sigh. Time to play the cruel mistress.\n","The sink cut off and Aaron felt a quiet thud in the pipes below him. Emma dried her hands quickly, then turned back. She placed her hands on either side of him and leaned over; her brown eyes seemed to stare directly into his soul. She wore no makeup and her hair was pulled back into a sloppy ponytail, but that didn't stop her tight-lipped, half smile from looking absolutely malicious. It took all his strength of will just to meet her eyes.\n\"Just so you know,\" she began. That British acccent that he had heard for so long from inside her own head sounded very different now that he was outside her body again. \"You didn't do anything wrong. I just wanted to show you what that was like. It wasn't pleasant, was it?\"\nAaron finally broke eye contact, letting his gaze fall and shaking his head. \"No,\" he muttered.\n\"What was that? Speak up, love.\"\n\"No,\" he repeated, louder.\n\"That's why I didn't make you ride out the whole thing. Just a little taste of it.\" She giggled, crouching down and folding her arms on the countertop. She rested her chin on her hands and eyed him for a few seconds. \"It wasn't a punishment, just a taste of one.\" She reached out and put a single giant finger under his chin, lifting his gaze to meet hers. Her expression was very serious now, her eyes at a height with his head, \"I'd never do that to you. Not unless you make me, understand?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Yes, mistress.\"\n\"Yes... mistress,\" he repeated. Her finger came away and his gaze fell back down. \nWith that, Emma stood back up, and, with a rustling of cloth, peeled off her sweatpants and sweatshirt, revealing just a pair of pink boyshorts underneath. He knew what was there already, he had been in her mind when she put them on the morning before, but he still couldn't help but look. She was an evil bitch, but, God, she was pretty.\nShe reached into the shower and turned it on, then stripped the boyshorts as well, kicking all the clothes into a pile on the far side of the bathroom. Aaron felt the room start to warm as steam slowly wafted out of the shower, and just watched, appreciating a view that he knew that most people didn't get, as Emma walked around stark naked to discard her scrunchie, let her hair down, grab her towels and place them just outside the shower.\nShe opened the door, then paused, looking at him. \"Well?\" she asked.\nIt took a minute for him to process what she wanted. She wanted him in the shower with her? That was... different. He approached the edge of the sink, and looked down at what felt like a fifty foot fall apprehensively. He looked back up at her to protest, and she cut him off, \"It's fine, just jump, you big baby.\"\nThat was a hard thing to do, but he forced himself to do it, hearing the sternness in her voice and afraid to anger her any further. He hit the ground with a thud and collapsed facefirst onto the cold tiles. He heard her stifle a giggle, but it didn't really hurt. He struggled up to his feet and started walking towards the shower, breaking out into a jog when he saw her eyebrows raise impatiently.\nHe had to climb over the lip into the shower, the green tiles at about waist height for him, and then he scurried over into a corner where the water wouldn't be striking him directly. The water flowing over the tiles and into the drain was at ankle height for him, but he had to fight against it in certain places to keep from getting swept off his feet.\nEmma followed him in and shut the door, trapping the heat and steam in and making everything echo. Aaron looked up at her from midway up her ankle, admiring the jiggling of her ass that came with every little step.\n\"So you understand,\" she said, as she soaked herself down and started to shower. Hot water bouncing off her body struck him as a fine haze, but it felt like a shower all of his own. \"My panties, my bra, my pussy, they're the best places I can keep you. It's not a punishment if I shrink you down and tuck you up under my clit, it's just normal.\"\nAaron had to dodge her foot as she turned around to grab her shampoo; she wasn't even looking down at him. She just left it unsaid that it was his responsibility to keep from getting caught underfoot, and, if he failed, that was his problem.\n\"If I give you the chance to please me,\" she continued. \"You take it. You should want those chances, even if you don't like being in my panties now. So letting you into my mind isn't a reward, it may just be because I'm tired of masturbating.\n\"If I punish you, you'll know it, and you'll know why. Having sex with me, being allowed to walk around my apartment, joining me in the shower like this, those are rewards.\"\nA sudden deluge of soapy water struck him like a brick wall, driving him to his back. Before he could get back up, Emma's foot swung around and landed right on his upper body. All her weight settled down on him immediately, and he kicked and squirmed, but she acted for all the world like she didn't even notice. Jesus, this was a reward?\nHe could still hear her booming voice, though. \"So enjoy it while it lasts. In case you didn't know, this is just a 'thank you' for enduring that little trip through my intestines. You had to see what it was like eventually, and you have been good enough not to really deserve it.\"\nHer foot lifted up, and he quickly scampered to safety before it came back down. He heard a thud, and Emma muttered, \"Fuck.\" He was just barely able to notice that she had dropped the bar of soap before she dropped into a deep crouch to recover it. Her ass came down on him faster than he could believe, and drove right down on his head, knocking him down. When she stood back up, she shifted her foot, sweeping up a huge wave of water that carried him helplessly across the slick tiles to the drain.\nHe lay there on his back, looking up at her body from between her legs. It was an unflattering perspective, staring up at where her thighs met her hips, the fold of her ass and the brown wrinkle of her labia. It wasn't pleasant, either, as water ran down her body and dripped from her crotch directly on to him. But it was probably the safest. Who stepped on their shower drain on purpose? \nAaron stood back up, noticing with disgust the tangle of red hair that was on top of the drain. At least here he could get a secondhand shower from the soapy water that dripped off her body.\n\"I've got a few things to do today, so you're coming with me once I dry off,\" she continued. \"My boyfriend is out of town, so you know what to do. I might let you out when we get home if you're good.\"\nThe sound of running water came to an abrupt stop when Emma shut off the shower. Then, either by accident or out of malice, her foot swiped Aaron hard, knocking him clear out of the shower and onto the cold, tiled floor of the bathroom. As Emma grabbed a towel and dried herself off, the drops of water that flew off her body hit him like cannonballs, driving him helplessly to the ground. Aaron tried to struggle to his feet, find a safe place from the routine of the giantess' life, but every move she made seemed deliberately intended to torture him. Eventually, her right foot kicked him clear across the room, and his chaotic tumble only came to a stop when her left foot came down on his chest. He was pinned, helpless, as the full weight of her body pressed down on the ball of her foot. \nAaron looked up, gasping under the pressure, at the beautiful shape of the giantess' body. The pale, well-muscled flesh of her thighs leading to the gentle curves of her ass. The spread of her legs protecting the wrinkled brown skin of her lasbia. A thought flashed through his head; what would it be like to be jammed up in that hot, sensual mess; and it was immediately suppressed by disgust. He had already spent days under the torture of Emma's genitals, how could he lust for more?\nBoth the question and the answer was immaterial. Emma bent down and snatched Aaron from underneath her foot. The sudden release of pressure left him gasping, but it only lasted a few seconds as she straightened up and led his tiny body between her legs. He didn't even have the time to catch his breath before he was rocketing towards the heat of her crotch. \nBefore he knew what was happening, his back was pressed against the hot flesh of her pussy. Her middle two fingers supported the weight of his body, and the rest of the fingers on that hand were drawn back in preparation for what came next. Struggling did nothing, but his instincts would not be denied. His hands gripped her fingers futilely, and his legs kicked under the false impression that there was anything he could do to stop the next step.\nHe had a split-second view from between her legs, the expanse of her thighs reaching down to the ground far below. It was the view he imagined her clit enjoyed every day. He could get used to seeing the world from that perspective, but he knew already that he would have to endure much, much worse from Emma before he would see that sight again.\nSuddenly, her middle two fingers slammed against his chest, and he was driven ass-first into her vagina. The bright, airy sight of the world outside was replaced with  an oppressive universe of heat, flesh, and wet. Every move he made was accompanied by the pounding of the giantess' heartbeat; the squelching of lubricant against flesh was the only noise that could overwhelm the rapid thud-thud of the giantess' heart.\nAaron was folded in half like a dollar bill, the pressure of the giantess' pussy squeezing him together harder than he knew they were capable of, and bending his body further than he knew he was capable of. His head was between his legs, something he had never done by himself, but at least it didn't hurt. God only knew what contortions his body had undergone when he had been trapped between Emma and her lover when they had sex, but this incredible expression of flexibility was the first that had lasted long enough for him to appreciate. If he could have bent over any more, he'd have been able to suck his own dick, which was, against his better judgement, painfully hard right now.\nThat was something that had been a constant lately. Maybe the profound sense of intimacy with the giantess was more significant than the helplessness he felt as her toy. Maybe it was the voyeurism of the routine sight of the most private parts of her body, or maybe it was just the hormonal overload of being forced to taste her pussy day in, day out. But his dick had been hard for the last few weeks even though he had felt no desire to relieve himself. Release had come on its own through various ways, including the impossible extreme of Emma taking control of his body and using him to fuck herself.\nBut his body seemed to be so much hornier than he was. He sought not sexual release but just a way to make himself more comfortable. The blood was pooling in his head, making the noisy rushing of the blood in his ears almost as loud as the distinct thud-thud­ of the giantess' heartbeat. But the worst part was that he didn't have near the strength to right himself. He was able to get his arms underneath him, but just pushing up far enough that he could bend his body straight up felt like trying to right himself when there was an elephant sitting on him.\nAfter about five minutes, Emma rewarded his efforts with a quick squeeze of her pelvic muscles, which slammed his face against the opposite wall of her vagina and left him gasping with exhaustion, more fluid than air sliding down his throat with every breath. Aaron stopped trying to right himself, enduring the torture of her everyday motion instead. The booming of her heart pulsed the walls around him, every step she took shook him left and right, and his entire world was run through with oppressive heat, overwhelming stench, and a seemingly endless source of salty bodily fluids.\nHe couldn't enjoy any of it like she said he should, but he knew that, eventually, she would want something else. She would probably use him as a sex toy, and he could endure those few minutes to earn a new, more comfortable position. In all likelihood, he wouldn't be stuck like this for more than a day, and that was something that he could endure.\nSomething inside him rebelled against that line of thought. That was what she wanted, he told himself. She wanted him to break, to become used to the torture of being stuck inside her body. If he came to view even one of his experiences inside her as favorable, she had won. He had to fight constantly, regardless of the consequences, and eventually he would know freedom.\nThat realization reenergized him, and he started to squirm. Basically all he could accomplish in his position was a very aggressive massaging of the walls around him, but it was enough to get the giantess' attention. Emma punished him with a brief squeeze of her pelvic muscles, but he had the will to wait until the pressure had passed to keep struggling. The third contraction that came lasted for a full minute, and he couldn't tell if it was the natural response to his efforts or a willful contraction. But Aaron was confident that continuing to struggle, proving his worth as a human being who didn't deserve to be treated as a sex slave, would turn out well for him in the end. The moment the pressure let up, he started to squirm again. But his freedom, such as it was, only lasted for a few more minutes.\nBefore he knew it, Emma's gigantic fingers dug into her vagina. Her middle two fingers forced themselves between him and the fleshy walls. She pulled him out in a flash, and, free from the pressure of her pelvic muscles, he unfolded into a wet, overheated mess in her palm, coughing up bodily fluids and taking his first desperate breaths of fresh air.\n\"You almost got me there. I guess you took my advice to heart,\" she said in a low whisper. Amidst the shock of being reintroduced to the outside world, Aaron was just barely able to process his surroundings. He was in a public bathroom, it seemed, and Emma sat on a toilet with her pants and underwear around her ankles. What advice was she talking about? Was it that one-sided conversation in the shower? He had spent the entire time trying not to get crushed underfoot, he hadn't really been paying attention to her dominatrix monologue.\nShe drew her face closer to her hand, or her hand closer to her face; it was hard to tell at this size. All he knew was that the pale skin, lightly-dusted freckles, and penetrating brown eyes of her face grew to a terrifying scale. There was a hunger in her eyes, and a half-grin below them. She chewed on her lower lip contemplatively for a second, then said, \"I have an idea. You're not gonna like it much, though.\"\nAaron was terrified that Emma would swallow him alive, but what came next surprised him. Emma lifted her ass off the toilet seat and bent down into a deep crouch. As she shifted him around in her hand, he didn't realize that she had been playing with his size until he was fully six inches tall. \nHe didn't realize her plan until he felt his feet pressed up against her asshole. He tried to struggle but he was fighting against the strength of a fist that was a hundred times stronger than he was. Before he knew it, his body was consumed by her anus up to his waist. Her grip shifted on his tiny body, and another thrust pushed him all the way down to his chest. Only the spread of his arms kept him from sinking any further in. \nHer hand drew away, but she stayed in the deep crouch. Aaron could feel the slimy heat of the giantess' colon enveloping his body to his chest. The massive bulk of her buttcheeks threatened to consume him the moment she stood up, and there was nothing he could do to escape it. The stink of shit was overwhelming, even worse than the fishy stench he endured while stuck under her vagina. \n\"Don't move too much unless I say,\" the giantess' voice echoed down from far above. \"Or you're going all the way in.\"\nWith that, Emma stood up, and the muscular flesh of her buttcheeks clamped down on Aaron's head. Only the breadth of his shoulders kept him from getting sucked all the way into her colon, but her ass still closed down with a predatory will on him. His thin view of the outside world narrowed to nothing as the giantess' ass pressed down on his upper body. And even that narrow sliver darkened as she pulled up her underwear, then her pants.\nThe extra pressure of her pants pressed her ass cheecks down even harder on him. Every step she took was torture. The gentle swaying of her hips was nauseating enough when he was sheltered inside her, but now her ass cheeks clenched against him every time her foot hit the ground, and jiggled spasmodically when her foot lifted.\nIt was like her ass was trying to chew him alive. The muscle on one side flexed hard, forcing him mercilessly into the other one, which bounced like jell-o before clenching without warning and shoving him back.\nHe had no doubt it would have been a nice thing to watch from the outside, but, from here, the almost-rhythm of the motion was pure chaos. The heat and the stench was overwhelming, and the pressure exerted on him by the flexing muscles felt like being crushed under a steamroller. A steamroller that rolled over his back, then his front, then his back, alternating over and over again forever.\nTo make matters worse, he constantly had to fight just a little bit to keep from sinking further in. Every time she took a step, he slid an inch or so into her anus, and, if he didn't push his way back out immediately, the next step would have forced his arms over his head and he would have completely lost his leverage.\nHe wasnt confident that Emma wouldn't have enjoyed having him lost all the way up her ass, but it was absolutely the last thing he wanted to happen. So he put all his focus on staying out, however torturous the innocuous routine of her walking was, and trying to move as little as was required to keep his head out of her asshole.\nGod, how long was this supposed to last?\n","This was not the first time that Emma had been in public with a butt plug, so she was a bit surprised that it had taken this long for it to occur to her that the little man would make a perfect one. It wasn't quite the vibrant stimulation of a vibrating plug, but she could feel his squirming and it was just as good, especially knowing that it was the struggles of a tiny man trying to keep from getting sucked up into her asshole.\nAfter thoroughly inspecting herself in the mirror to make sure that nothing showed, she left, feeling quite satisfied with herself. Just a quick trip to the grocery store and back, she promised the little man silently. See if you can hold on that long. She'd have to think of things to do with him when she got home; an hour or so with a living buttplug would get her pretty worked up. \nInteresting fact: there was an entire subreddit devoted to her bum, which was flattering in a voyeuristic kind of way. She had a pretty firm policy against nudity, but that didn't stop the creeps from salivating over every angle they could find of her. She wondered how many of the perverts would switch places with her little toy if they had the opportunity. She could, but she didn't particularly want to, at least not yet.\nMaybe when they got back. An idea of how she could use the little man started to form in her head, and she was getting horny enough that it sounded like damn good fun.\nAs she walked around, feeling the little man's continued struggles against her ass, she guessed with a mental shrug that she really couldn't judge the creepers. They might like looking at her ass, but she had a human being trapped inside hers at Aldi's. That was a level of sexual perversion way above a bit of celebrity porn.\nShe didn't even realize that the gentle tickling was making her flex her pelvic muscles involuntarily until the tenth or so time that it had happened. When she finally noticed, she had to stifle a giggle. That had to be painful for him. Just for fun, she stood straight and clenched her asscheeks together, as hard as she could.\nHe struggled quite a lot when she let go, and she giggled again, and carried on with her shopping. The only time she had to really worry about him was when she got into the car, taking care how she sat down so that her weight didn't push him all the way inside her. Then, during the twenty-minute drive home, she slowly shifted her weight so that more and more of it was pressing down on his head, feeling his struggle to stay free intensify. It was like turning the vibration on high.\nThe very first thing she did when she got home was strip herself completely naked to give the little man some air to breathe. Then, as she started putting the groceries away, she said, loud enough for him to hear down there, \"We're going to switch spots, okay, love? Kick a little if you can hear me.\"\nShe felt the dull pressure inside her as he kicked his legs, and she smiled. \"I want to enjoy a little bit of what you've enjoyed, so you're gonna take over up here and I'll take over down there. Sound good?\"\nHe didn't respond for a second, then she felt him kick again. She gave him a playful squeeze and giggled. \"Don't do anything that would make me punish you, okay? Remember, I can check in any time.\"\nShe let him into her mind in preparation for giving him control, then a thought occurred. \"Oh, and, one last thing. If you shove me all the way in there, the game's over. You can stew in there yourself.\"\nEmma gave him control and switched to her mind. The assault on her senses was overwhelming, exactly what she had hoped for. She couldn't masturbate as him or risk sliding in, so she waited to see what her little toy would do now that the roles were reversed.\n \n Suddenly, he was Emma Watson. In the few seconds he had before the transition, he thought of every way possible that he could use the opportunity to escape his situation, but every single one of those could be stopped before he even hit the door. Even so, this was the first and best chance he got to escape this ridiculous life as her sex toy.\nBut the shock of the transition, the moment he turned into her, made him forget about that for a moment. He was compelled suddenly to learn his way around his new body, feel its strength and its shape. He had spent plenty of time behind Emma's eyes; able to experience everything she did but unable to control it; so he was familiar with the weight and rhythms of her body. But he had never had the chance to inspect her this way; even when she looked in a mirror, he couldn't control the focus of her eyes.\nHe raised his... her... right arm, marveling at how light, how thin, how almost fragile it seemed. His left hand ran up her thigh, fingers playing across the smooth skin and gentle curve, gripping her ass briefly just to feel how it felt. It didn't really have the erotic thrill he expected. \nHe cupped one of her breasts, looking down in fascination as he gently squeezed it and ran a thumb over the nipple. It stiffened almost immediately, and he felt a shiver, a gently whispered promise of ecstasy, wash up and down her body. That was the thrill he had been expecting, and a subtle but insistent voice in the back of his head rose up, demanding satisfaction. He instinctively knew how to get it, too, but he suppressed the urge. He didn't have time for that.\nHe had to figure out how to escape. He didn't know how long he had, but it wasn't long. Emma was in his body, apparently either perverted or horny enough to enjoy the experience that had been his torture for the last few hours, but she could get tired of it any moment and steal control back from him without warning. She could even be watching him right now, making sure he didn't do anything like exactly what he was planning to do.\nJesus, could she read his mind? She hadn't given any indication that she could yet, but he was thinking her own thoughts in her brain, and she was in his mind. He didn't know the specifics of her powers, nor did he really know that much about biology, but that uncertainty left him scared. \nThere was no way to help it. If she could read his mind, she was either playing with him or would have shut him down already. In either case, he had to figure out what to do, and fast.\nHe had to distract her, that was the key. Do something that make her want to stay in his body. He could feel the pressure inside him; even the subtle motion of her struggling to keep from sinking further in was a strong, highly sensual feeling. That was when the most obvious choice in the world occurred to him.\nHe ran her left hand between her legs and slowly started to massage, rubbing her fingers in circles until he closed in on the spot, and a gentle spike of pleasure made him gasp suddenly.\nIf she let him keep doing this, it meant that she wanted to ride it out in his body, or so he hoped. He was slow, trying to keep a clear head as the pleasure became more pronounced and the lust more insistent. He needed some way to get a message to the outside world in a surreptitious way.\nThere, a stack of sticky notes on top of the refrigerator. He grabbed one and the pen that was next to it, trying to click the pen as quietly as possible. He even let out a little moan to cover the noise. He wrote his note and quickly put everything back.\nShe hadn't stolen control from him yet, so she didn't notice, but he had to put the note somewhere where she wouldn't find it, but her boyfriend would. The bedroom was across the apartment; that was the best spot, he figured, since she always slept on the same side of the bed. So, still rubbing her clit, he made his way quickly to the bedroom and crashed onto the bed.\nSlipping the note underneath his pillow, he leaned back, tilting her hips up so he wouldn't smother his own body underneath his ass, then gave completely into the building lust.\nHe alternated between massaging her clit and fingering her, aggressively seeking more and more pleasure instead of savoring the rise to orgasm like she did. He had been behind her eyes when she masturbated before, and the pleasure that her body gave her was like nothing he had ever experienced as a man. But being in control of it was a totally different animal. Feeling the penetration but not being able to control it had an uncomfortable similarity to being raped, but now he could lie back and enjoy it thoroughly.\nThe sensation of his body struggling in her asshole was electrifying, too; he could totally understand why she had done it. He could feel his body in her ass through the wall of her vagina, and tried not to let the thought of being back in his own mind spoil the mood.\nShe came in about five minutes, and he lost everything to the pleasure. Her entire body seized up, desperate gasps escaping her lips, her back arcing and her pelvic muscles squeezing almost painfully hard. It was incredible. It could have lasted five seconds or five hours; in that moment, he had no concept of time.\nWhen he came down enough to control her body again, he tried starting again, going back for the clit before her muscles had stopped clenching. But it was far too sensitive. He couldn't even touch it without gasping, so he just lay back, face flushed and breathing heavy, as he rode the steadily-declining wave of pleasure.\nSuddenly, he could no longer control her breathing, and he knew immediately that she had locked him out. \"Wow,\" she said aloud. \"That was so fucking hot. I'm glad you had fun, but you didn't let me get any.\" \nShe rolled over onto her side and bent one of her legs up. She reached behind her and grabbed his tiny body by the arms, pulling him out of her asshole. He was tickled for a moment by how much the sensation felt like taking a shit, and was surprised when he heard the tail end of a giggle escape her lips.\nHe was in control again? He rolled over and saw himself standing there, a full six feet tall again, stark naked, hands on hips, and with a raging erection. He eyed her... himself, for a moment, confused, until his own body said, in a British accent that seemed wildly out of place, \"Well, go on then, suck it.\"\nWhat the fuck? What kind of twisted shit was that? A tremendous range of conflicting emotions ran through his head, not the least of which was disgust. He had never even thought about sucking his own dick before, but now he had to do it as Emma Watson? \nThe only comfort was that it was far from the most disgusting thing she had done to him thus far, and, when he was done, she would be left with the taste of cock in her mouth, not him. Slowly, reluctantly, he brought her body up to his, and she took a step back, forcing him to get off the bed and onto his knees. He gave himself one last look, and his face just raised its eyebrows pointedly. \nThink of it as getting a blowjob from Emma Watson, he told himself. You can even make the bitch swallow. Wondering how the hell his life had gotten to this point, he wrapped her mouth around his own cock, trying not to gag at the salty, fleshy taste.\nJust get it over with. He started sucking, licking the shaft up and down, fondling the balls, trying as hard as he could to do it without opening her eyes. He tried every trick he could think of, but there was no way he was good at this. What guy possibly could have been?\nThe only silver lining was that, after being worked up for so long, his own body barely lasted two minutes. His body groaned above him, and the flex of his own cock and sudden shoot of sperm into the back of her throat took him by surprise. He forced himself to swallow it as quick as possible, slurping down as much as he could before she recovered from the orgasm and took control again. \nIt was disgusting and slimy, but not anything he hadn't experienced tiny already. At least this was some small bit of revenge. As he felt his cock go limp in her mouth, he lost control again, and Emma stood up and stepped back. He watched through her eyes as his body rapidly shrunk, and she wiped her mouth. \"I was wondering if you'd swallow. You must like the taste more than I thought.\"\nBefore he knew it, he was back in his own body, barely four inches tall and staring at a giantess as she straightened her hair miles above him. \"I get why guys like that so much,\" she said, bending down and grabbing him. She didn't even care to look at him. \"You don't have to do anything.\"\nWithout delay or preamble, she shoved him headfirst into her vagina. The cool, bright air of the outside world transitioned into the heat, pressure, and fluids of her body in a way that he had experienced a hundred times. It still never ceased to be an assault on his senses so profound that his body started to involuntarily struggle, some deep-seated instinct that told him that he was being swallowed and had to fight with his life to escape.\nThere was no escape, though, and his struggles ceased in seconds. He could never fight against the strength of her body at this size. But now was different, now there was a sliver of hope. A tiny seed planted that, if he was lucky, would blossom into freedom at last.  \nHe could only hope that she didn't find out too soon.\n","Emma couldn't help but resent her toy for having swallowed, because now cum was all she could taste. She supposed it was her own fault, in a way; she hadn't told him not to; and she couldn't really tell if he was trying to take the initiative and make it hot or trying to get revenge. With that uncertainty, she didn't feel comfortable punishing him for it. After all, it was kinda hot.\nBut mouthwash still seemed like a good idea. It still surprised her a bit that the first thing he had done when in control of her body was start masturbating. He had done well, too. She could still feel the warm afterglow of a deep, satisfying orgasm. But, holy hell, experiencing it from the perspective of her tiny toy had been something else.\nHer body did things that she wasn't even aware of. She never guessed that the simple act of walking would batter him so severely when he was trapped in her ass. She never knew that a gentle flexing of her pelvic muscles would clench her asshole so tight; every contraction had hit her so hard down there that it had driven the air out of her lungs, leaving her seeing spots with blood pounding in her ears. \nAnd, Jesus Christ, masturbation was something else. She had never given a thought to the little motions of her body as the pleasure built and the climax came, but, from that perspective, they were terrifying. Her hips rocked back and forth, pressing him down with every pass so that she had to fight with all his strength to keep from getting sucked into her own asshole. Her ass cheeks clenched hard, squeezing him with the force of a steamroller until his lungs burned for air. And when she came, her asshole clamped down with a will, as if it was trying to chop him in half while, at the same time, it tried to suck him all the way in.\nFuck, it was hot. Even if she hadn't been able to cum while in his body, it was totally worth it. There was so much potential in trading places with him, too. She could ride it out as a speck of dust between her fingers while she rubbed herself off, she could see firsthand what a dildo saw as she masturbated. She could even be trapped microscopic between herself and her boyfriend as they fucked. \nOne sexy experience after another crossed her mind, but they would all have to wait. Most of them required more trust than she had in her toy. For now, though, she knew that her little toy had probably tried some desperate escape gambit while he was in her body. She just had to figure out what it was.\nShe checked the time. Her boyfriend would be coming home in an hour or so, and she was still feeling a bit kinky. Her little, squirming toy stuck deep in her pussy was an afterthought, but still enough sensation to keep the embers hot. She took a shower, popped one of her birth control pills, then slowly fished her little toy out of her vagina.\n\"Hey, little guy,\" she said, letting him slowly shrink down even further. \"Sorry to bother you. You ready for a real ride?\"\nBy the time she finished speaking, he was only a dot in her palm, barely a millimeter tall. She shifted her finger around, until he was a black speck on her middle finger, then lifted her right leg up onto the sink. \n\"We're going to have a lot of fun,\" she said to nothing, knowing that he could still hear her. Then, without further preamble, she pushed her middle finger into her asshole, only up to the first knuckle.\nOh, this was going to be fun. She put on a pair of boyshorts and a clingy white T-shirt; she knew what got her boyfriend going; and she was waiting for him on the couch when he got home.\nA few glasses of wine and an episode of Game of Thrones later, she wasn't really sure what had happened, but she did remember that it wound up with her on her hands and knees, ass in the air, telling her boyfriend, \"Fuck me in the ass!\"\nThe wine was really getting to her. Her last coherent thought, as she felt her boyfriend's cock slide carefully into her asshole, was that the tiny man was gonna love this.\n \n Aaron hated everything that was happening to him. The moment he was shoved up Emma's asshole he hated it. The only way it was like her vagina was the pink color of the walls around him, but that was where the similarities ended. The ridges of the walls that surrounded him were gigantic and spread far apart. He was between two of them, in a cavernous space that was larger than anything he had experienced in her cunt.\nHe could just barely see her asshole from here, a tight, puckered opening that twitched impatiently with every step she took. If he had been able to free himself from the slime that held him fast to the smooth walls, he would have fallen down right on top of it.\nThere was, at least, room to breathe here, but that just made it worse. The air was rank with the stench of shit, and tiny flakes of it, no bigger than he was, scattered the walls here and there. He could just count himself lucky that he wound up stuck to a relatively clean part of the giantess' colon.\nThe massive, fleshy tunnel, five times larger than he was tall, twisted out of his view far above him. He knew that the rest of her intestines lay in that direction, and he could only wait in fear of what would come down that path for him. Maybe, if he was lucky, she would pull him out before things got really disgusting.\nSuddenly, gravity shifted, and the giantess' asshole was above him instead of below him. Were it not for the clingy slime that coated his body, he would have tumbled down even deeper into her colon. Before he could process what was happening, the wrinkled opening to her asshole parted to admit the purple head of the most massive cock he had ever seen.\nOh no. Oh God no. He struggled, but even if he managed to free himself from the sticky walls, where could he go? Down was towards her intestines, up was towards the giant's cock.\nHe didn't have much choice in the matter, though. Emma's colon may have been gigantic to him, but it hugged her boyfriend's dick tight. Slowly, it pushed its way in. Slowly, it shoved its massive, pulsating bulk against his face. Slowly, it dragged him from his relatively safe spot and shoved him deeper, deeper, deeper in.\nBut then it started to pull out. He got caught underneath the head and ground mercilessly between the inside of her asshole and the rock-hard body of his cock before he finally rolled out from underneath it. He was deposited somewhere near where he had been originally, watching as the giant penis slowly drew out of Emma's ass.\nBut that wasn't it. Of course it wasn't. The man's dick drew all the way out of her asshole, but the wrinkled opening didn't squeeze all the way shut this time. Instead, Aaron got treated to a view of the man's package, his dick quivering and balls swaying, before he came plunging back in.\nThis time, he was not so gentle. He drove himself into her like he was drilling for oil. Aaron was carried along helplessly, his body twisted and squeezed and whipped back and forth over and over again. The thick layer of water-based lubricant that coated the man's cock made sure that he would never really escape this torture. The giant could drive as deep in as he liked, but the sticky fluid would make sure that Aaron would follow along as he pulled out, just to get rammed again as he made another thrust.\nAaron was just about to accept that this was his fate now, to be ground eternally between Emma's colon and her boyfriend's penis, before it finally ended. After what felt like an hour, the man came, but he was unfortunate enough to be stuck right to the tip of his penis when he did. The first shot, a deluge of sperm that shoved its way past his closed mouth and up his nose, was powerful enough to push him deeper into Emma's body than he had ever been. And he watched, through a murky white haze, as the cock flexed a few more times, pushing out a few more waves of sperm that just drove him further and further down.\nThen, when he was so far down that he could barely even see it, the cock pulled all the way out, leaving him helpless in a sea of sperm somewhere deep in Emma's colon.\nGod, just stand up, please, just stand up, he begged. The woman must still have had her ass in the air, because gravity pulled him, and the stream of cum that he was helplessly trapped in, steadily further down. Eventually, the curve of her colon hid her asshole from view, and that was when he lost all hope. He was doomed to stay in here until she took a shit big enough to force him out.\nBut then gravity did shift, and not in a terribly favorable way, either. Suddenly, neither the path into or out of her was up or down. A thin rivulet of cum ran down the side of her colon, carrying him along until he settled in an opaque white pool. She had laid down, he realized. Jesus, was she going to leave him here all night?\nThe unbearably salty taste of the man's cum mixed with the unbearably rancid odor of the woman's colon. She couldn't leave him here all night, could she? He had to be able to get out of this. He struggled, but, at this size, fighting against the man's semen was like fighting against Jell-O. Eventually, he tired himself out, laying back and breathing deep breaths of hot, slimy bodily fluids. \nFuck her. Fuck her, he thought. At least he had that note, the tiny sliver of hope that was his best and last chance of escaping this hell.\nIt was all that kept him going all night. The world around him was too hot, too smelly, too overwhelming to all his senses for him to really get comfortable. He just listened to the steady rhythm of the giantess' heartbeat and waited, waited, waited.\nHe may have dozed off towards the end, but it was suddenly interrupted by a dramatic increase in his size. Before he was even fully awake, he felt the giantess' colon squeezing him from all sides. The ridges that seemed cavernous were now uncomfortably tight. Instead of an ocean, the giant's cum was just another uncomfortable layer of fluid. And, most importantly, he could see the exit.\nIt was tight again; neither air nor light from the outside world was let in, but it was there. Slowly, he started to crawl towards it. He saw it flex, twitching involuntarily at the sensation of him moving along, but nothing stopped him. Clawing at the slippery walls and kicking desperately, he made his way along inch by inch until he was face-to-face with the giantess' asshole. He was working with gravity this time, maybe it was his chance to escape. He shoved his hand out, looking for the leverage he needed to get out, and was surprised to feel her massive fingers grab his wrist.\nWhat little hope he had turned into despair in the pit of his stomach. The giantess took a firm grip on his wrist and slowly pulled him all the way out. The cool feeling of fresh air slowly consumed his body from head to toe, and the light outside was blinding. Before he could process what as happening, Emma had him dangling in front of her face, still held up by the wrist. In her other hand, she held the sticky note he had left under her boyfriend's pillow.\n\"What is this?\" she demanded, her eyes blazing.\nOh, fuck. Emma had gotten lucky. When her boyfriend was done with her, he took off to the shower, and she pulled her boyshorts back up and stumbled her drunken ass to bed, sprawling out across the sheets and letting out a happy sigh.\nIt was only then, when her hand found its way under her boyfriend's pillow, that she found the sticky note. She realized immediately what it was the moment she felt it, before she even pulled it out to read it, and it was the most sobering realization of her life. She froze, but the shower was still running; she was safe.\nHer heart was suddenly racing. Jesus, five more minutes and she would have been doomed. She pulled out the note, it was short and in quick, sloppy handwriting, almost illegible despite the block letters.\n\"SHE SHRANK ME. USING ME AS SEX TOY. HELP\"\nShe was torn, still terrified of how close she had come to having her crime unveiled, furious at the little man for doing this, but honestly a little impressed that he had managed to pull it off without her notice. He had only been in charge of her body for a few minutes, after all, and she thought he had just spent all that time masturbating.\nShe quickly folded up the note and stuck it under the mattress on her side of the bed. At that moment, she heard the shower cut off, and she practically had a heart attack. A bit jumpy, perhaps, but fuck... She had come only a few minutes away from losing everything. She didn't know what the punishment was for having a shrunken slave, but she knew that her boyfriend would not go along with it if he found out.\nShe had to be more careful. She still didn't have the relationship with her toy that she wanted, and, until she did, she couldn't afford to give him that much control. As much as it disappointed her, her role-swap fantasies would have to wait. If she broke things off with her boyfriend, she might have the time and space to build that relationship a little more efficiently, but she wasn't comfortable doing that, at least not yet. He was a good guy; he may have been a short-term fling, but he had a good attitude and a great dick.\nShe cupped her ass idly, thinking about the man still trapped inside there. Oh yeah, he'd be staying there all night, but he had a way worse punishment in store. Maybe he'd spend a week in her sock, maybe she'd eat him. She'd figure it out, but, more importantly, she had to figure out where to go from here, how to turn him from rebellious slave into willing servant.\nFrom his view, discovery meant rescue. How the hell did she get him from that to the point where he didn't want to be discovered, because it meant he wouldn't get to be with her anymore?\nShe had shown him trust, at least some, but it was clearly too early for that. She had tried to break him by punishing him, but that only seemed to make him more desperate to escape. Maybe the first step was demonstrating, somehow, that rescue was impossible. Then, once he had accepted the inevitability of his new life, he would eventually teach himself to enjoy it.\nShe grinned, wiggling her hips contentedly into the mattress. Maybe it was the booze, but she just had an idea, and it was downright villainous. \n \n"," Aaron stared at the note, unbelieving. What little hope he had vanished, and a deep fear replaced it. Oh God no, she was going to do terrible things to him for this, things that would make him wish for death even though it would never come. He couldn't meet her angry gaze, and he let his head drop, staring down at the ground far below his dangling feet. He was fucked. \nEmma crumpled up the note and tossed it onto the bed, then, in a sudden whirlwind of motion, tossed him after it. The mattress was soft, but the impact still drove the wind out of him. Climbing slowly, miserably to his feet, he looked up at her, waiting for the other shoe to drop. \nShe was wearing pink boyshorts and a clingy white T-shirt that rode up to expose her midriff. She wasn't wearing a bra underneath, and he could see the dark circles of her nipples through the fabric. Her hair was mussed up from the night before, and she still seemed groggy, maybe even a bit hungover. She stared at him, hands on hips, anger radiating from her tired eyes. \n\"You didn't think I knew? You've tried this before,\" she said. \n\"Wait, what?\" he asked, out loud. He wasn't sure if he was supposed to speak now but that statement was so surprising he couldn't help himself. \nShe rolled her eyes, straightening her hair and tugging down her shirt. \"I told you, I own you.\" She sat down on the bed next to him, and the springs creaked under her weight in a way that they never would under his. She wasn't heavy, but the indentation she put in the mattress was like a pit that he had to struggle from tumbling down into. \"I can have your memory wiped any time I like. This is the third time I've done it and this is the fourth time you've tried that little trick.\" \n\"No way,\" he said, again out loud. How could she wipe his memory? Surely, he would have... remembered? No...  \n\"Yes way,\" she said, imitating his accent. She giggled, then leaned down towards him. Her face was gigantic, and he could smell the trace of alcohol from then night before on her breath. \"After the first few months, you just give up, and that's no fun for either of us. I like it when you have a bit of life in you.\"\n \nHe shook his head, letting his gaze fall again. There was no way for him to know if she was telling the truth, but his gut screamed at him that it was impossible. He would never give up. He would fight until he escaped or she killed him. He couldn't imagine... \nShe put a single finger under his chin, bigger around than his leg, and lifted his head to look at her. Her massive brown eyes were intelligent and piercing despite the brown circles beneath them. It felt like she was staring into his soul. \"If you don't believe me, tell me this. Who are your mum and dad?\" \nThat was easy. He opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came. He had parents, but he couldn't remember their names, their faces. Were they still together? Did he live with them? His mind started racing. He couldn't remember anything. When was he born? Where did he live? Who had he been before this? \nNothing. He didn't remember anything before waking up in that little metal box. His mouth fell open in shock, and Emma straightened back up, smiling. \"You always have a few more tricks you try before you finally break, but this is the first time I've told you the truth,\" she told him. \"This is your life now. We've done all this before and we can do it all again, if you like. Or you can accept it and be the servant you're supposed to be.\" \nHe was silent, uncomprehending. What did she know? What else had he tried to do to escape before this? Was this all scripted? Was there anything he could do that she wouldn't anticipate? Dread filled his stomach, heavy to the point of nausea. If she got tired of him, she could just reset him, and he would live forever in a loop of hopeless escape attempts and eventual acceptance of his servitude. \nHe knew who Emma Watson was, so he had some memory of the time before, but what was the last thing he had seen her in? Harry Potter had come out years ago, and that was the last time he had even thought about her. She looked older, at least he thought she did, but what year was it now? Had he been with her that whole time since the movie came out? \nEven if he knew the date, it wouldn't help him. He could have been with her for two years or two weeks. Eventually, if she was telling the truth, he'd be staring up at a woman in her mid-forties, being told the exact same thing and still not believing it, not remembering a single minute of what had come before. \nHe didn't say anything for a long while, and Emma just looked down at him, a half-grin on her face. God, he hated her, but how long had he hated her for? How many times had he come to accept her? Fuck, this was hurting his head. Every escape plan he could imagine hit a dead end when he realized she had probably seen it all already. What the fuck could he do? \nShe stood up, and the bed sprang back in a sudden and violent way that knocked him right down on his ass. She kneeled down and rested her chin on the mattress, right in front of him. Her head was taller than he was; all he could think of was how easy it would be for her to open her mouth, snap him up, and swallow him whole. God, she could take control of his body and he would willingly dive into her throat. \n\"I'll tell you this, you never liked the punishment that came next,\" she told him. Her hot breath would have knocked him on his ass if he wasn't already down. She grinned at his stunned, terrified look, then stood up. \"We'll skip it this time, okay? Come on, let's take a shower.\" Oh, God, not again. But it was at least better than whatever she had planned for him as punishment. She stood up again and pulled off her shirt, her breasts popping out from underneath it in a very satisfying way as she dragged it over her head. She threw it onto the bed behind him, then paused before she started to strip her underwear. \"Well?\" she demanded. \"Go on, get in there.\" \nHe obeyed with only a moment's hesitation, jumping off the bed and making his way at a quick walk towards the shower. He heard the sigh of her panties coming off behind him, then the pounding of her footsteps. Even knowing that he was invincible, the sound filled him with a primal terror, and her right foot came slamming down beside him so hard that he fell over. He looked up as her massive body passed rapidly over him, and stared, captivated, at the jiggle of her ass as she made her way out of the bedroom and into the bathroom. \nGod, he hated her, but that didn't stop her from being hot. It was difficult to appreciate from inside her, and that was where he spent most of his time. But when he got the full view... He felt a tingle in his groin, and had to remind himself sternly that she had told him to get in the shower, and he was lagging behind now. He didn't feel like incurring the punishment he had fortunately dodged, so he got to his feet and ran after her. \nShe had already turned on the shower when he got there, and was waiting outside, feeling the water and waiting for it to get hot. He scampered up between her legs and quickly hopped over the rim of the shower, scurrying to what he knew was a safe spot over the shower drain.  \nThe water was aimed at the back wall, but he could feel it. Still lukewarm, but getting hot fast. After a minute or so, she stepped in after him, seeming not even to notice him, and shut the glass door behind her. Again, the sound of the shower became a deafening echo and steam started to fill the space.  \nNo hair over the shower drain this time, but he was watching the woman's feet. She wasn't quite straddling the drain, just a few inches forward of it, but she shift her feet anytime and he would inevitably wind up trapped under her heel. He looked back and forth between them constantly, looking for any signs of movement to dodge away from. \nHe heard her let out a contented sigh, and he was suddenly aware of the fact that the water around him was starting to turn a faded yellow. He looked up, and saw  a steady stream of piss flowing from her crotch.  \nHe could smell it now, heady and thick. Disgusted, he immediately scrambled backwards, away from the water swirling around the drain. He wound up with his back against the wall when she finally finished, then grabbed the shampoo and started to clean herself. \nUnder the heavy flow of water, the smell of urine dissipated almost immediately. He could see her thighs and the curve of her ass out the corner of his eye, and a horny corner of his mind longed to stare at her, but he knew he had to avoid her feet lest he suffer under her weight. They could move at any time and stomp down on him, and she wouldn't give a shit about it. \nSo, while he was staring at her feet, he didn't notice what was happening above him. She ran her hands through her hair to rinse it out, and a wave of water came washing down, striking him right in the head and driving him to the ground. He was carried with the water towards the drain, and, just before he reached it, she moved a bit to grab the soap, and her right foot came crashing down on top of him. \nHe saw it coming down, and the curse that he was about to utter was cut short when all the air was driven out of his lungs by the weight of her entire body. He was trapped head to toe beneath the arch of her foot, the pounding of his own blood in his ears overwhelming even the sound of the shower.  \nEvery second under this massive weight was torture, but, before his lungs started to burn for air, she lifted her foot, and he scrambled on his hands and knees back to her shower drain. He chanced a glance away from her feet, and saw her scrubbing at her skin with a washcloth, leaving behind foamy soap that was immediately washed away by the water. \nHe sighed unhappily. Just five, ten minutes, he told himself. Enjoy the chance to clean yourself off and try to stay out from underneath her feet. Then you can go back to living with whatever sexual torture she dreamed up next. \nHe looked down and saw that he was hard. God dammit. Sure, she was hot, but what the hell would you even do to her if you had the chance, he asked himself. He would have to use his entire body to please her, and he already knew how much of a miserable experience that was. Why did he let this get him so aroused? \nDare he risk it? He looked up at Emma, staring at her body from a perspective that absolutely nobody in the world got to enjoy. That tight, wrinkly slit of her vulva may have been the source of all his misery, but it was a hell of a thing to see. Hoping to get it over with quick, he wrapped his hand around his dick and started jerking off, drinking in every detail of her body and fantasizing about wrecking that pussy with his cock as a full-size human. \nTo his surprise, she started to masturbate as well. With the washcloth in her left hand running steady circles over her tits, her right hand found its way between her legs and started massaging her clit.  \nOh yeah, that was it. He stared at the giant hand, pressing the soft flesh of her crotch in every direction, and kept jerking off, determined to finish as fast as he could. \nShe gasped, leaning forward with her hand against the shower wall, and he came. His tiny squirt of semen was washed away by the shower water almost instantly, and the brief moment of pleasure lasted just long enough for her to cum as well. As the clarity and mild disgust that followed masturbation washed over him, he heard her choking scream, and watched her hand freeze in place, her legs quivering. \nThat was pathetic, he realized. Masturbating to the sight of his torturer, the woman who owned his life so completely that she could control his fucking memories. But at least she hadn't seemed to notice. He shifted his gaze back to her feet, and almost dove out of the way as she moved, but she was just bringing her legs a bit closer together, apparently having recovered from her orgasm. \nHe managed to avoid getting crushed beneath her feet until she cut off the water. When she opened the door and stepped out of the shower, her right heel hit him right in the head, and he was bowled over, sliding all the way to the far edge of the shower. It was a blow that should have killed him, he knew, but immortality was his curse. Now fully out of the shower, she grabbed a towel and started to dry off. \nNo such luxury for him. He'd have to air-dry. He hurried after her, though she had left the door wide open with no indication of shutting it. He clambered over the lip of the shower and landed on the tile floor of the bathroom, his wet feet slipping out from underneath him and slamming him down on his ass again. \nShe didn't notice or didn't care. She finished drying off and wrapped the towel around her torso, then grabbed another towel and started to twist it around her hair.  \nNothing to do now but wait, he supposed. He climbed back up onto unsteady, slippery feet, and fell right back down again when he shrank abruptly to a tenth of his size.  \nEach tile was a continent now, the grout between them a massive canyon. He could have run at a full clip for an entire day and not reach the bathroom door. Clearly, she had a plan for him, and he was sure that he wouldn't like it. \nHe stared up at a godess of infinite size, a towel wrapped around her body and another piled up on top of her head, as she bent down and pressed her middle finger against him, driving him facefirst into the tile. For a brief moment, it felt like being crushed underneath a steamroller, then she pulled up and he clung to the thin layer of water on her fingertip. The motion as she picked him up was dizzying in scale, miles passed in mere seconds, the ground beneath him receding at a terrifying pace, but he was still trapped by the ridges of her fingerprint and the surface tension of the water.  \nShe didn't bother explaining herself, and why should she? He was a toy, her property. He'd better come to accept that now; at least then he could retain his memories. If he didn't just totally give up, and if he didn't keep rebelling, he might stand a chance. If he pretended to be her willing toy, to try and please her at every turn, he might get the chance to escape. \nThe world whipped by too fast for him to follow. Suddenly, he found himself between her legs. Her left hand had spread her vulva open for him, and the pink flesh ringed with the wrinkly brown of her labia rocketed towards him with terrifying speed. With the quick dexterity of a spider preparing its meal, she tucked him up underneath a fold at the very top of her vulva. \nHer finger came away, and he remained clung to a thin layer of vaginal lubricant like the speck of dust he was. It was hot, even hotter than the shower, and he was so small that he could feel her flesh quivering with every heartbeat at his back. Then her left hand pulled away too, and his view of the outside world vanished as her labia snapped back together. Everything was flesh now, smooth flesh and suffocating heat, the smell of soap mingling with the fishy scent of her genitals, the fluid that he couldn't escape washing down his throat and filling his mouth with the same taste.  \nIt took a minute for him to process where he was, but he recognized the smooth nub of pink flesh beside him. She had tucked him up underneath her clitoral hood, and he was trapped between her labia and the clitoris. The tiny organ was larger than he was; if she had had a piercing, it would have been as big around as his entire body. Even if he kicked, bit, and scratched with everything he had, he doubted the sensation would do anything but get her horny, if it even registered with her at all. \nIf he had been a bit bigger, it would have been a position of power. He would have been able to bring her to orgasm at any time, and she would have to race to the bathroom or risk cumming in public. But now it was just humiliation. He could practically hear her cute British accent telling him, \"Go ahead and try, you can't do anything to me I won't want you to.\" \nGod, she was right. This was his life now, wasn't it? He pushed at the giant bulb of her clitoris angrily, but, as he expected, he didn't even get so much as a twitch in response. He didn't even have the strength to really earn any leverage against the pressure of her labia against his body.  \nHe just had to remember. Keep the fight alive. Freedom meant doing what she asked, pretending to be the slave she wanted. He had to pretend like he wanted it, like he enjoyed it, and eventually he could turn around and make a real bid for freedom when she least expected it.\n","Emma ignored the quiet tickle between her legs, or at least tried to; her clitoris was especially sensitive. Some women could open up with clitoral play, but it was overwhelming to her. She had to work up to it, to get horny enough that it was all she wanted, and, even then, it didn't take long for it to finish her off. She'd had guys that had rushed for the clit like horses out of the gate, and it had been far too much raw sensation for her to handle. She had always squirmed out of their grip, not trusting her passion-filled voice to be convincing enough to get them to stop.\nAnd she had placed her shrunken toy right up against that sensitive button of flesh. She literally could not make him smaller than he was right now, but she could still feel him. The sensation wasn't strong, but it would be enough to bring her to orgasm if she closed her eyes and focused on it.\nBut it was still subtle enough to suppress, as long as she didn't spend too much time focusing on it. And that's what she did. She was still naked save for the bath towel, but she had put a pause on her morning routine to find the paperwork that had come with her shrunken man.\nShe had hidden it as best she could, and with good reason; it spoke far too explicitly about her shrunken toy, describing her contract, the cost, and the capabilities of her new purchase. For a company that prided itself in its discretion, a five page, double-sided contract on legal paper seemed far from discreet. \nSo now she was digging through a forgotten box of charity clothes, trying to find the pocket that held the paperwork, and cursing herself, her toy, her boyfriend, and the company that had charged her so much for this miserable situation.\nThere. Her fingers gripped the corner of a wad of paper, and she slowly pulled it out, drawing the contract from the pile of clothes as if from quicksand. The paper emerged with deep folds and wrinkles, looking like something that had been fished from the garbage. There was not a more incriminating document in the world; Emma would have to find a safer storage spot for it after this. Maybe some kind of Swiss Bank safety deposit box?\nBut it had the information she needed now. She skipped past the sections about her financial obligations, about her powers over her new toy, and about the legal traps she should avoid. There was a bit in there about teaching her toy how to enjoy its new job, and that's what she was looking for.\nShe had ignored it at first, certain that she knew what she needed to know about people. But being famous, giving people an image of you that they could love was a completely different beast from teaching a slave how to really love you. She had to teach someone who, for now, wanted nothing more than freedom that he should want nothing more than to make her happy.\nA little tickle of pleasure, and she let out a soft noise, shifting her hips a bit. It wasn't strong, but it was enough to notice. \"Calm down,\" she breathed, both to her toy and to herself. She was tempted to force the little man to remain still, but she didn't want to give away that he was hitting all the right buttons; she had put him there to ignore him, she couldn't afford for it to be a place that he could control her from.\nOr so she thought. This paperwork from the company was valuable information that she should have paid attention to from the very start. \nLove your toy, it said. Reward it early and often with whatever reward is appropriate for your relationship. The more dominating your relationship, the longer you should spend rewarding your toy for worthy behavior. Eventually, it will accept certain behavior as normal and reject rewards, and you can adjust the standard, make ever more servile behavior worth reward each time. Expect each cycle to take one to four weeks.\nThat was vague, but it was already enough to let Emma know she had fucked up. Positive reinforcement, goddammit. She had punished her toy for fucking up, and hoped that the promise of future punishment would keep it in check. She had done the opposite of what she was supposed to do. \nShe flipped through the handbook, looking for a remedy to her problem, and tossed it down angrily when she realized that there was nothing. She was on her own. If obedience came through positive reinforcement, then what she had done up to this point had done nothing but foster rebellion, and she had to find out a way to turn that around.\nJust wipe his memory, right? Start over again. That desire was strong, to be sure, but the desire to prove herself, to demonstrate that she could reprogram the most rebellious of toys, was stronger. \nAnother tickle; not strong, but persistent. Emma managed to fight the instinct to bring her hand between her legs, but it took effort. And her toy was nothing more than a mite against her clit. She sure wouldn't be able to go out in public like this, even though she had thought at first that she could handle it. \nMaybe it was the same pathway, she realized. Obedience through reward was still possible, she just had more ground to cover. But what rewards could she offer at this point that he wouldn't abuse? \nAutonomy, in any fashion, was out of the question. Given what she had just told him, he would doubtless come up with the most insane plan possible to ensure his freedom, and she would not catch it until it was too late. \nSo she had to find a way to control him that was more pleasant, or at least that seemed like a reward. She had stuck him in her ass, in her pussy, and even under her foot. But maybe he'd enjoy being in her bra, or even in her pocket? Or, shit, just left alone in a case for a day. It might be boring, but so was where she had put him now.\nOh, that was something. The cage with a bit of entertainment. Give him a book or Netflix, a way to pass the time. She could give him a day to himself while she was out, and still use him as a sex toy at home. It'd be something for him to look forward to, something for him to work for. \nA sudden wave of pleasure drew from her a sharp gasp. Her face tensed for a moment, trying to resist the temptation to bring her hand between her legs and finish the job. When it finally passed, she thought it might be a good reward for not doing that. \nBut... oh, fuck. Another pang of pleasure made her eyes cross a little. He wasn't supposed to know he was that effective down there. Another few minutes, though, and it might become very obvious to him that he was treating her body in all the right ways, even at his miniscule scale. \nEmma took a deep breath and rubbed her legs together, hoping to shift the little man from his position. She wasn't sure if she succeeded, but the subtle and insistent sense of pleasure faded when she did it, and, for the next few minutes, she didn't feel any overwhelming sense of ecstasy.\nOkay, that was good. So she had to buy a cage for the little man and turn it into a reward. And, if she was going to keep him somewhere separate from her body, she'd have to have her flat to herself. And that meant, unfortunately, that she'd have to break up with her boyfriend. \nThat was a shame. He was a good man, and he gave good dick. It was a big gamble to assume that she could somehow groom her new toy to the point that it could replace him, but she had already spent the money; it would be irresponsible of her not to make the fullest effort to turn her shrunken man into the perfect toy.\n \nAaron, trapped inside the folds that surrounded Emma's pussy, was busy hating his life, and periodically lashing out at the wet flesh that surrounded him. Gravity shifted in unpredictable ways, the giantes walking about, sitting down, bending over, or any one of a thousand routine movements. He was no longer privy to exactly what she was doing, but he had a front-row seat to the worst part of it.\nHis world was nothing but pink, an undying pressure pushing at him from all sides, and fluid so plentiful that he couldn't help but breathe it in. When he was able to gasp down a lungful of fresh air, the thick, fishy smell was so strong that it made him gag, and he inevitably wound up sucking down another mouthful of lubricant. \nHe punched, he kicked, he screamed. He would not let himself just be an audience to this woman's life, a speck of dust entirely ignored but forced to observe her morning routine. He fought until his body, demanding oxygen despite its invincibility, was left sucking down breath after exhausted breath of hot fluid.\nNothing. He took a break for a few minutes to catch his breath; it was infuriating that he 'caught his breath' by filling his lungs over and over again with slimy vaginal fluids. If he could literally drown with every breath, and live through the experience painlessly, then he should be able to struggle endlessly without his body demanding a 'breather.'\nHe thought he heard something, or maybe he felt something. A sudden gasp, a quick shift in the giantess' balance. He paused, breathing deep the seemingly endless ocean of vaginal discharge that surrounded him, as if it were fresh air and not the slimy secretions of a woman's most intimate organ. Something that told him that his microscopic efforts were at least having some effect. But, as he lay there, chest heaving, nothing followed. For one minute, maybe two. Gravity shifted repeatedly, the flesh around him sliming up and down his body, but that happened with every step she took. Was he actually having an effect, or had he just imagined it? \nFuck it. He started kicking and squirming again, weaker this time thanks to the protests of his tired muscles, but he wouldn't give up. He took a gamble and targeted the area that he thought was closer to her clitoris, doing everything he could at his insignificant scale to move the infinite flesh that surrounded him.\nThe shift that followed was violent, sudden, and unexpected. Gravity shifted ninety degrees, and he was suddenly upside-down. He barely had a minute to wonder what was happening before Emma spread her legs, and the sudden breath of fresh air on his back told him that she had removed her pants and panties as well. Fear settled into his stomach before he felt the incredible pressure of her finger at his back.\nIn a deafening, blinding cacophony of flesh against flesh, she dragged him out of her crotch and lifted him high, high, high into the air. The motion felt like being shot out of a cannon straight to the moon. He had a split-second view of her body, wrapped from breasts to thighs in a sky-blue bath towel, before he was face-to-face with her piercing brown eyes. Her cheeks flushed, her nostrils flared and her sharp jaw set in anger, she eyed his rice-grain body with absolute fury in her eyes for a moment before she finally spoke.\n\"You've fucked up, love.\"\n \n\"So here's the thing,\" Emma said, \"I've given you loads of chances to be the toy I want you to be, and you still fight back. What? Do you think you're going to get away from this?\"\nShe shook her head, staring angrily at the flyspeck on her finger. He was so tiny that she could barely make out the fact that he was shaped like a human. And he had been able to bring her to the brink of orgasm at that size? Fuck.\n\"I own you. How many times do I have to say this? I own you. You either be the toy I want you to be, or I flush you down the toilet and get a new one,\" she said sternly. \"Do you want to live as fish food forever, or with someone who actually cares about you?\"\nEmma, her finger still wet with fluids that held her tiny toy fast, made her way to the kitchen. With her off hand, she put an empty bowl, a box of cereal, and a quart of milk on the island. She produced a spoon and held it up for the tiny man to see. \"Right, I've arranged for someone else to teach you the lesson that you refuse to learn from me. They'll be by shortly, but, in the meantime, I want you to learn that I am in charge here. Nothing happens to you unless I want it.\"\nWith that, she flicked the tiny man into the bowl. She could just barely see his tiny dark figure against the white ceramic. But, satisfied, she grabbed the box of cereal. \"You want to fight, love? Fight this.\"\n \n","Coughing and gasping from the force with which his body had hit the ceramic, Aaron took a few long, crucial seconds to figure out what was going on. By rights, the force of his hit should have killed him, but he seemed to be immortal, at least for now, so he was cursed to survive whatever bullshit she thought to torture him with.\nBy the time he was able to regain his bearings and process his surroundings, Emma had finished speaking, and he could see a cereal box, of all things, lifting high above his head, slowly tilting down to pour its contents directly on top of him.\nFuck. He couldn't escape this. He just had to lie there, helpless, limbs trapped in a thin, sticky layer of human fluids, as lumpy whole-grain cereal poured down on top of him. \nThe noise was deafening, the food clanking against the ceramic of the bowl. The appetizing brown color filled every corner of his vision, until a single kernel came plummeting down on top of his head. It bounced off like a kickball, but left him dazed and confused, unable to process what was really happening until he had been buried deep under an avalanche of food.\nThat wasn't it, he thought. Who ate cereal dry? \nThe deluge of opaque, freezing-cold white milk came without warning. It came in from all directions, a flood that immediately dislodged him from the bowl and sent him twirling mercilessly through a dense field of cereal. He bounced painfully against grain after grain until he finally reached a resting point on the chilly surface of the milk.\nStaring upwards, he saw Emma Watson from an incredible perspective. She didn't even seem to know he was there. Her bathtowel still wrapped around her body, another tied up in her hair, she sat over his bowl, a spoon held idly in one hand and her phone in the other. Whatever was on the phone, it captured her full attention, because she brought the spoon down to the bowl without even looking, and scooped up a gigantic volume of milk and cereal.\nThe action was cataclysmic to Aaron. He fought furiously to stay afloat, but it was useless. The moment her spoon sank into the bowl, he was dragged under, and it was only pure luck that he wasn't dragged out with the spoonful of cereal that she brought to her mouth. A few seconds  later, after suffering a seemingly endless bombardment of cereal bits, he finally surfaced, gasping for fresh air. \nHe knew, deep down, that he could breathe the milk like air and he wouldn't die, but his body wouldn't acknowledge that fact. He swam around cereal grains twenty times larger than his body, he struggled against the insignificant wake made by the giantess' spoon, all to keep from being sucked under. That was all his body knew to do. \nThere was no escaping, and he knew that, to be honest. How could you escape someone's breakfast when you were just barely larger than a grain of salt? He tried because instinct screamed at him, but it was ultimately meaningless.\nIt was Emma's fourth bite. Her spoon came down, and the massive wall of metal crashed into the frigid milk not ten feet from Aaron's face. Her wrist twisted, her arm lifted, and suddenly he was rocketing into the air, carried in a cold pool of milk straight to her mouth.\nHer eyes didn't even see him; she was still looking at her phone. Her lips, yet untouched by makeup, parted wide, revealing the deep, dark hole of her mouth. In less time than it took to describe it, Aaron, along with the spoonful of ice-cold milk and cereal that carried him, were plunged deep into that cave, and her lips came slamming shut behind him. The spoon tilted, and suddenly he was spilled onto the burning heat and wet flesh of her tongue.\nIt was terrifying, beyond anything he had ever seen, but it was fascinating at the same time. Her tongue surged up to the roof of her mouth, forcing the milk and the food to the sides, and then her teeth began to work at it. Aaron was lucky enough to stay in the center of her tongue, pressed painfully against the roof of her mouth, as her teeth crunched mercilessly through the cereal.\nHe could see it, just barely, but he could definitely hear it. The hard grains crunching between the giantess' unyielding teeth sounded like a chorus of cannons. Milk washed over him, each wave stealing the breath from him in its abrupt wall of cold. Against the unbearable heat that came from Emma's tongue beneath him, and the roof of her mouth above him, even tiny flecks of the cold milk felt like being pelted with ice cubes.\nEventually, the giantess' tongue twisted and writhed underneath him, and Aaron was shoved to the back of her throat. For a moment, he floated amidst a lukewarm paste of half-chewed cereal and milk, no sound audible but Emma's steady heartbeat, and then she swallowed.\nAaron fell. So far, so fast. With a sudden squelching sound, her throat opened up, and Aaron was carried down in a lump of mushy fluid all the way down her esophagos and into her stomach. \nWith a splash, he hit the bottom, falling straight through the thin layer of fluid at the bottom and hitting the flesh underneath. The impact was so hard that it drove the wind from him, and the breath he took afterwards was a hot mix of half-digested food and stomach acid.\nThe flesh of her stomach squirmed and heaved relentlessly under him, mixing food with acid and slowly guiding the mix towards her intestines. He tried to gain his feet and was tossed immediately onto his back, then onto his stomach. The fluids only really came up to his waist, but it was enough to drown in. And he would have drowned, acid burning his lungs from the inside-out, if he hadn't been cursed with immortality.\nBut still he fought. He would not spend another week inside Emma's digestive tract. Eventually, he managed to work his way to the side of her stomach, somewhere where brown-grey stew of food and fluids would not carry him helplessly further downwards. Her stomach continued to twitch and heave, but he was able to keep himself in his position, shoving feet and hands into the winkled folds of her stomach in an effort to keep from being thrown loose.\nOnce or twice every minute, another mushy brown offering came pouring down from the hole above him, plopping noisily into the mix below. It had been steadily draining down, but not as fast as she ate. The watermark crept slowly upwards, and he kept trying to climb away, until he was no longer sure of his footing, holding desperately onto a near-vertical wall of flesh as hot slime lapped at his shins.\nThis was his third time down here, and, goddammit, he was not going to rely on Emma's goodwill to survive it unscathed. He was a human being, not a morsel of food, not a toy to be discarded. He would fight with everything he had.\nBut she's just eating breakfast, a part of him said. She's not even trying to torture you. No matter what you do, her stomach will do what it was built to, and you will be carried down like the tiny snack you are.\nAaron stubbornly ignored that voice, holding on as spoonful after spoonful of chewed-up cereal came pouring down, as the half-digested mixture came up to his knees, to his waist, to his chest. Each one he hoped was the last, and he screamed and cursed in desperation as more and more came.\nThe heaving and tossing of her stomach was making him nauseous, but he held on for dear life. Eventually, with the chyme riding almost up to his neck, the deluge of food finally stopped, and the level finally started to come down.\nHoly fuck, he thought. She's finally done. Now all he had to do was hold on, just like he had, and wait. He'd ride this shit out in her stomach.\nAnd then what? She'll eat again, and again, and again. That's what people do. You can't survive every meal for the rest of her life, he told himself. Might as well let go and get it over with now. Sure, a trip through her intestines is unpleasant, but at least it's a break from her.\nNo. No. That was the mindset of a man defeated. He didn't wish for a brief reprieve from her sexual torture, he wanted to escape it forever. He wanted to see justice dealt for what she had done to him, and that meant fighting her with every breath. Submitting to her body was just the first step towards becoming the slave that she wanted.\nThat line of thought lasted until Emma finally stood up. Her body shifted so abruptly that the contents of her belly were tossed about in absolute chaos. A wave of hot slime washed over Aaron, and he was dragged helplessly from his 'safe' spot and straight into the pool that had settled at the bottom of her stomach.\nHe barely realized what was happening, but he instinctively started to fight for the surface. He barely made two strokes before Emma started to walk. Each and every step she took sent the fluids that surrounded him sloshing around, and, with each distant thump, he drifted further and further towards the bottom. He was the only thing not rendered into a foamy mess of half-digested matter, and the sheer force of gravity forced him further and further down into the pool of food in her stomach.\nFighting for his life, gasping desperately for air but only breathing slimy chyme, Aaron barely noticed that he had passed through the bottom of her stomach and into her intestines. It took almost ten minutes of tired fighting for him to realize that there was no end to the fluids, that a tight tube of hungry, squirming flesh surrounded him on all sides.\nHe screamed.\n \n\"I'm so sorry to waste your time, Dominique,\" Emma said, drawing the whistling kettle from the burner. \"I watched it happen. He fell all the way down...\" She patted her belly as she poured the steaming hot tea into Domonique's cup, \"It's probably going to be a few days.\"\n\"Oh, hush, Emma,\" Dominique said, taking the cup of tea and swirling it around. Her accent sounded almost exactly like it did on the TV, with the rough touch of Cockney. Emma may have given it a bit of extra posh for the cameras, but Dominique didn't bother with the effort. She appreciated that about her. \"You have to do what you have to do. Honestly, I'm surprised he's still this stubborn after all this time. How long did you say you had him?\"\n\"Ten days,\" Emma said, pouring herself a cup. \"But he spent a bit of that time in... you know...\"\n\"A full tour?\"\n\"You could say that.\"\n\"And he's still rebellious even after that? You just put him on a second tour.\"\nEmma nodded, sending a gulp of hot tea down after the tiny man; he was probably deep into her small intestine by now. \"And he fought like fire the whole way down. I watched him do it.\"\nDominique nodded thoughtfully, taking a slow sip of her tea. \"Why didn't you save him, if you were going to pass him off?\" she asked.\n\"He was already too far down by the time I went to look,\" Emma explained. \"I didn't want to hurt myself by sizing him up.\"\n\"That can be easy to do,\" Dominique replied. \"Are you going to make him sit the whole thing out?\"\n\"Probably not,\" Emma said with a shrug, \"Maybe make him think I care about him before letting you have him.\"\nDominique shook her head. \"You're overthinking it. Cruelty to break them, kindness to remake them. You give them an uneven mix and you just make it worse for yourself.\"\n\"That's not what the book says.\"\n\"The book is fucking stupid. You're not training a dog.\"\n\"So was yours this... rebellious?\"\n\"Oh, no,\" Dominique said, laughing. \"I honestly think she wanted to be a toy. Only took about three days before she would do anything I asked. She even helps me break other people's toys now.\"\nEmma rolled her teacup between her hands, feeling the warmth. It was still vaguely uncomfortable for her to talk about this, with the knowledge that it was a massive crime with life-ending consequences. Dominique's cavalier attitude about the whole affair just made her feel more awkward. \"Can I... meet her?\"\n\"Sure,\" Dominique said, taking another sip of tea. Noticing Emma's expression, she added, \"Oh, not now. She's at home cleaning up.\"\nEmma's mouth dropped in shock. \"What, really?\"\n\"Oh, darling, once they're broken they're great,\" Dominique told her, a conspiratorial look crossing her face. \"I even let Suzy come with me to shootings from time to time. People just think she's my American friend.\"\n\"That's amazing.\"\n\"But come by any time. She'll meet yours eventually so it couldn't hurt for her to meet you,\" said Dominique. \"What is his name, by the way?\"\n\"I... don't know,\" Emma said, her eyes widening. She had never even bothered to ask. Honestly, she wasn't sure if she had even considered the fact that he had a name.\nDominique frowned. \"See, that's a problem. You have to know their name. That's how you start the personal relationship.\"\nEmma let a long sigh out through her nose. \"Should I just have his memory reset?\"\nDominique waved off the question, \"Oh, no, I like the challenge. Just bring him by my place when you can and we'll get started.\" She grabbed her teacup off the table, then set it back down, gesturing excitedly, \"Oh, and you have to try out Suzy. She can do things that are just...\" \n\"Appreciated, but I'll pass,\" Emma said. \n\"Suit yourself,\" Dominique replied, huddling her tea up to her chest with both hands and wearing a sultry grin. \"I'll get your man-with-no-name there for you.\"\n\"Really, Dominique, I can't thank you enough for this.\"\n\"It's my pleasure, Emma, really.\" She downed the last of her tea and set the cup down, her face going serious. \"But first you need to tell me everything you've done to him already.\"\n \n","Aaron rode helplessly through the giantess' intestines, listening to the pounding of her heartbeat, varying constantly in its pace, and the unintelligible vibrations of her speech, muffled by endless tons of flesh. Scarcely an hour had passed since he had lost his fight to Emma's stomach, and his disgust and fear had already subsided, replaced by sheer boredom.\nIt was hot. Unbearably hot. Heat coated his flesh and filled his lungs with every breath. He barely even noticed the sour taste of acid and half-digested food anymore, but he couldn't ignore the heat.\nHe was so small, but not small enough to avoid being dragged relentlessly against the walls of her intestines. The slow, steady pulsing of the flesh around him, combined with the random motions of her body, slowly pushed him along, but he was caught between folds of flesh for minutes, sometimes even an hour at a time.\nHer small intestine, he knew. It squeezed tight around him, forcing his tiny body through a ceaseless vice grip. The flesh was even more wrinkled than that inside her vagina, and seemed almost furry. Old anatomy knowledge surfaced, telling him what made that fleshy carpet and what purpose it served, but what use did that do him here? He wasn't going to get absorbed into her bloodstream any time soon; he just had to endure the vilii squrming around his limbs like hot, slimy grass.\nBoredom seemed like an incredible thing, given that he was experiencing firsthand a view that any biologist would kill for, but that's really all he felt. He was being pushed through Emma's intestines even slower than her food, but he knew what was waiting for him at the end of this trip. He didn't really feel like swimming to make it end sooner.\nSo he waited, lying there and wishing that he could just fall asleep. He had done it before inside her vagina, but, as the first day, then the second day passed, he never even felt a little sleepy. Maybe it was the heat, maybe it was the constant lungful of slimy fluid, or maybe it was some other curse of this shrinking bullshit. In any case, he had to personally experience every inch of the woman's intestines. \nHe tried to masturbate a few times, but really couldn't get it up. He tried to grind against the wall of her intestines, but it was like trying to fuck a wet shag rug. His failed attempts to get himself aroused made him hate her even more.\nShe had sex on the third day. He could hear the muffled, but very distinct pleasured moans, and he could feel the steady, jerking up-and-down motion as she rode her boyfriend. Even surrounded by pale, sickening flesh, even breathing lungful after lungful of foul slime, the sensation was enough that he was able to jack himself off. His pathetic squirt of semen was immediately lost to the acids that surrounded him.\nIt still felt like a victory. He had no idea why, but he got a sense of vindication of it, rather than the brief wash of shame that should have followed. Her body had broken his cum down and absorbed it in a matter of minutes, as it should have done long ago to his body, but, God dammit, it was still his moment of triumph.\nThe transition from her small to large intestine was clear by the sudden and abrupt passage through a tight tunnel of flesh, forced into a much wider tunnel that, though the same color as the hell he had passed through over the last four days, lacked the fuzzy, heavily-textured surface. He passed through in a mix that was thicker and more viscous than anything he had been in before. \nHe knew what was coming next, and, on some level, he was disgusted by what was happening. But the transition from clear, acidic fluid to where he was now had been so slow that he barely noticed it happening. Eventually, the slime around him darkened, thickened, and finally solidified. And, eventually, he was carried along with a solid mass ten times larger than his body straight out of her ass and into the toilet.\nThe impact into the water threw him clear, and he floated there for a moment, staring at the giantess' bare ass in the darkness of the toilet bowl. A part of him feared, or maybe hoped, that she would just flush. Send him out of her life forever. Maybe living as fish food would be preferable to his life with her.\nNo such luck. Without wiping, he noticed, she stood up, turned around, and her eyes immediately met his. \"Finally,\" she said, reaching down with one massive hand to scoop him up.\nFuck.\n \"Hello, Suzy,\" Emma said, shaking the woman's hand awkwardly. Don't look. Don't look. Don't look.\n\"Emma Watson, it's such a pleasure to meet you,\" Suzy said enthusastically, grabbing Emma's hand with both of hers and shaking it up and down. Emma had to try very deliberately to ignore what the motion did to the other woman's breasts. \n\"Dominique has told me a lot about you,\" Emma said, pulling her hand free after the handshake went for a second too long. She meant to follow it up with more, but was too uncomfortable to figure out what to say next. It was all she could do to keep her eyes from drifting down.\nSuzy noticed, apparently, and spread her arms wide, spinning on one heel. \"Oh, go ahead, look. What is there to be ashamed of?\"\nBefore Emma could even respond, Suzy took a quick step forward and pressed her body up against her. Emma felt like she could almost feel the heat of the other woman's bare skin through her clothes, and she felt her cheeks growing red.\n\"I'm not ashamed,\" Suzy said, her voice growing husky. She ran one hand down Emma's back and cupped her ass, prompting a sqeak of surprise from her. \"And I'm not afraid,\" she whispered into Emma's ear. \nEmma was frozen, and her eyes bulged as she felt Suzy's other hand work its way into the waist of her pants. The cool tendrils of her fingers brushed against the bare flesh of Emma's crotch, and Emma almost melted into the other woman's touch. God, just a few...\n\"Suzy!\" Dominique barked. Her voice sharp and authoritative. Emma snapped back to reality and Suzy took a rapid step back, a look of fear crossing her face before she was able to compose herself. \n\"Sorry, ma'am,\" she said, crossing her hands in front of her and looking down, ashamed.\n\"Oh, don't be sorry, love. Just save it for another time,\" Dominique said.\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\nDominique's face took on an expression of pity, and she set her tea cup down, standing up and approaching the other woman. \"Don't you worry, Suzy. You'll be able to make it up.\"\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\nDominique stepped up and raised Suzy's head by the chin. She met the other woman's eyes for a moment, then barely brushed her lips against hers. When she let go, Suzy's head dropped again, but Emma noticed the barest smile on her face.\nDominique went back to her seat, a bit of a triumphant swagger in her step. She picked up her tea to take a sip, then paused. \"Oh, Emma, get that look off your face. Go ahead and look.\"\nEmma's self-control broke, and her eyes scanned downwards hungrily, drawing in everything about Suzy's naked body. The other woman, Dominique's human sex toy, had been sized up to her full height, about as tall as Emma. Her shoulders were wide, and supported relatively large breasts that still hugged tight against her chest. She was probably in her early twenties. Twenty-two, maybe twenty-three? But for how long she had been that age, Emma could not guess.\nHer nipples were a dark, dark brown, only a few shades above black, and small, only about the size of a quarter. They poked just barely above the areola, but that might have just been the temperature. Against her pale skin, they seemed even darker than they really were.\nShe was thin, but not lanky. Fat smoothed out muscle definition and lent weight to her hourglass figure, and the tops of her thighs just barely touched with her feet together. It wasn't enough to hide the tight, bare-shaven cleft of her labia, though. Emma let her eyes linger for a second on that triangle-shaped junction, her imagination toying with a few crazy notions before she brought it in check.\n\"She's beautiful,\" Emma said. \"Congratulations.\"\nDominique grinned, and Suzy's smile grew a bit as well. \"Well, to be fair, the Program helps out a bit.\"\n\"Why a woman?\"\n\"I thought the shape would feel better going in,\" Dominique said with a shrug. Suzy's smile didn't budge. \"Besides, she doesn't come inside me when we fuck.\"\nEmma sat down at the table as well, grabbing the tea that Dominique had poured for her. Suzy still stood in place, head down, seemingly waiting for an order. Emma leaned forward, her voice barely over a whisper, and said, \"I kinda like that.\"\nDominique eyed her with a raised eyebrow. \"You fuck your boyfriend bareback?\"\n“Oh yeah.”\nDominique laughed, and Emma leaned back, the chair creaking underneath her. “Well, Emma, you made the right choice,” she said. “Don’t worry, we’ll have a toy to replace your boyfriend in no time.”\nEmma gave a bit of a half-smile, still wondering what on earth she was going to do to let her boyfriend down easy. She still liked him; she didn’t love him, but she didn’t want to hurt his feelings either. “Thanks again, Dominique.”\n“Don’t worry about it, love. Before we get this started, do you want to have a go with Suzy?”\nEmma eyed Suzy, and the naked woman barely moved. She couldn’t help but linger on the gentle curve of her ass, baser instincts debating among themselves what best to do with the woman. She wanted her head between those thighs, but, at the same time, maybe Dominique was right. Maybe those curves felt better going in...\nShe shook her head, trying to clear the thoughts. “No, but thanks.”\nDominique stared at her for a moment, as if she knew her indecision. Honestly, if she had pressed even a little bit, Emma would have eagerly accepted, but, thankfully, she didn’t. “Alright then,” she said. “Where is your tiny man?”\n“I’ll get him,” Emma said, putting down her teacup and standing up. Before she could step away from the table, though, Dominique grabbed her arm.\n“Emma, no,” she said seriously. “You can’t pretend like nudity is anything to be ashamed of. It’s part of making them think that sex is normal.”\nEmma hesitated, glancing between Dominique and her toy, Suzy. \"You sure?\" she asked.\nDominique rolled her eyes and set her tea down. She stepped back from the table and pulled her shirt up over her head. She wasn't wearing a bra, so her slight breasts flopped down freely, revealing broad nipples a few shades darker than her skin. The left nipple was only a hair bigger than the right, and her breasts hug tight to her chest. Emma was a hair jealous, especially considering that the other woman was older.\nShe undid her shorts, letting them fall to her ankles and kicking them to the corner, and revealing that she wasn't wearing underwear under those either. A thin rectangle of curly hair sat above an otherwise bare crotch, and the loose lips of her labia were clearly visible. Emma averted her gaze immediately, but she noticed that Suzy snuck a look that may have lingered a second too long.\n\"There,\" Dominique said, spreading her legs and arms, inviting examination. Her breasts jiggled just barely as she did so. \"It's fine, see?\"\nEmma tried to meet the other woman's gaze, the only part of her body she felt comfortable looking at, but broke it quickly enough. She nodded, then took a step back away from Dominique and shed her pants and panties. Dominique barely seemed to pay attention, returning to the table to finish her tea, and Suzy didn't even look, her eyes fleeting towards Dominique and away again. After a moment’s pause, trying to figure out the relationship between the two, Emma slowly slid her middle finger into her vagina.\n“Wait,” Dominique said suddenly.\nEmma felt downright foolish, pausing in the middle of fingering herself, but Dominique was not even looking at her. “Suzy,” she said. “Come here.”\nThe naked woman obliged without hesitation, walking over to Dominique. Emma saw how every step sent a subtle wave through her flesh, set her breasts jiggling, and couldn’t help but get a bit horny at the sight.\nShe wasn’t a lesbian, or at least she thought so. Still, God damn, this Suzy was absolutely gorgeous.\nDominique grabbed Suzy’s wrist, and the woman shrank quickly and without warning. It was insane to watch from the outside; the woman went from six feet to less than six inches in only a few seconds, leaving Dominique holding onto her arm with just two fingers. She carried the tiny girl over to the table and set her down, a bit less than gently. Then she returned to her tea. Right before taking a sip, she asked, “How tall is he?”\n“As small as I could get him,” Emma answered, still shocked. Somehow it seemed totally natural for her toy to change size when she controlled it, but, from the outside, it was absolutely inhuman. She had never seen anything so unbelievable.\n“Perfect,” said Dominique. “Now bring him out.” She took a sip of tea and added, “Suzy, you know what to do.”\nEmma barely heard the tiny woman’s voice acknowledge, “Yes, ma’am.” A small part of her regretted what she was doing, wondering if she had made a mistake given the absolute weirdness of it all, but she had paid a lot to join this world. Might as well embrace it.\nShe shoved her middle finger back into her vagina, probing for the mote of dust that was her sex toy. She couldn’t find him until her ring finger went in as well, searching the inside of her pussy like the pocket of an old pair of jeans. Eventually, she finally got him, trapped to the tip of her finger by a thick layer of vaginal fluids. Emma wiped him off on the table, right next to the shrunken Suzy. Then, brushing her wet fingers off on her thigh, she crossed her arms and stood back.\nTime for Dominique to work her magic.\n \n","It took a minute for Aaron to realize what was happening to him. After he had finally passed through Emma’s body, she had only sized him up just barely enough to clean effectively under a deafening deluge of cold sink water. Then she shrank him back down and, without explanation or even foreplay, shoved him knuckle-deep into her vagina. \nA few hours passed in a miserable, but familiar environment. He was but a speck of dust against the massive walls of her vagina; somehow, that situation was better the smaller he was. At least it was less claustrophobic when the wrinkles were larger than his entire body. It didn't help the oppressive heat, or the nauseating randomness of her body's movements, but it was something.\nHe was used to spending days here, sitting through the rhythms of Emma's life from a place where he could never comprehend them. Her walking, her working out, her sleeping; it was all unpredictable, but it had a note of consistency to it. So he was surprised, and almost terrified, when her fingers came digging into his fleshy hell, dragging him abruptly into the shockingly bright and cold world of the outside.\nBefore he knew what was happening, he was lying on a cold, dark surface. He struggled to his feet, trying to process his surroundings. The texture of wood grain surrounded him in all directions, and, in the distance, he saw Emma, totally naked, staring at him with her arms crossed. She seemed miles away, and her expression seemed almost bored.\nHe span around, and saw another woman, as gigantic and as naked as Emma. She had a thin face, a sharp jawline and sharp eyebrows; her eyes were a captivating brown that competed with the color of her unblemished skin. Her slight breasts were laid bare, revealing slightly asymmetrical, dark brown nipples; Aaron couldn't help but feel like he belonged between those breasts, even though he knew he would barely be noticed against her skin.\nSmiling a bit at the body of the giantess before him, Aaron turned and found himself face-to-face with a pale, stark-naked tower of humanity. \nHe fell back and scrambled away, letting out a yelp of surprise. It took him a moment to comprehend that standing in front of him was another shrunken person, scarcely six inches tall, but she absolutely towered over him at his current size. It seemed impossible to comprehend how small he was with Emma, and this other, unknown giantess sitting at the table on either side of him, mountains in their size and distance. But this third woman, barely half a foot tall, brought the reality right to his face. He didn't even come up to her ankle, and her body just seemed to go up and up and up and up as his eyes scanned up to meet her face.\nA feeling of dread started to settle in his stomach with the realization that this woman was so big compared to him, and still would have fit comfortably in the palm of a normal person's hand. The dread grew suddenly into fear when his eyes reached hers and he saw the stern, angry look on her face.\n\"Like what you see?\" she asked, raising an eyebrow. Feet shoulder-width apart, hands on her hips, \"What's your name?\"\n\"I, uh...\"\nAbruptly, her left foot came shooting forwards, bowling him backwards and stomping him mercilessly into the table. His head stuck out from under her big toe, leaving him free to see her unchanged expression, but the rest of him was caught under her foot. \"Your name,\" she demanded again.\nGod, her weight was tremendous, and she probably wasn't even putting all of it on her. He tried to gasp for breath, to speak, but he couldn't. His mouth gaped like a fish out of water but he couldn't make so much as a squeak.\nIn an impressive display of flexibility, she bent at the waist, holding him pinned under her foot, until her head was at her knees. Brushing air away from her ear, she tilted her head as if she was trying to better hear him. \"What's that? You need to speak up.\"\nHe could only muster a weak rattle. \n\"I'll wait here all day until you tell me,\" she said, eyeing him with the gaze of a disapproving parent.\nAaron tried and tried to breathe, to push her foot off him just so he could get some air in his lungs, but she wouldn't budge. God, she was tiny; at his full size, he could have effortlessly flicked her across the room, but here he was, trapped under a woman who couldn't have weighed more than a pound, and it felt like she had settled a building on top of him. After a few painful seconds, just as his lungs started to scream for air, she pulled some of her weight off, and he managed to draw in a raspy gasp of air.\n\"Fuck you,\" he said.\nThe woman drew her foot up, just enough that she could slam it back down, this time trapping his entire body under her weight. The soft, pale flesh of the bottom of her feet wrapped around his face, cutting off all air, and crushed him with unbelievable force. \nThrough the flesh that surrounded, through the roaring of the blood in his ears, he heard her say, \"Later.\" The sole of her foot vibrated as she spoke. \"But I need to know your name first.\"\nHe fought and squirmed, but he couldn't budge. He couldn't breathe. His lungs burned, the pressure on top of him felt like it would pop him any moment now. \"Come on, just your name. It's not like you need to wine-and-dine me.\"\nShe had an American accent, he realized. He should have felt a kinship at that, but all he felt was betrayed. He tried to speak his name, hoping that she would notice even under her foot, but he couldn't get out a single peep. Just lift your foot, bitch, he thought, I'll tell you. Please.\nHer foot came all the way off, bathing him in sudden light and allowing him to draw a desperate breath. He sank immediately into a coughing fit when he did so.\n\"Stubborn one, huh?\" she asked, straightening back up. \"We can fix...\"\n\"Aaron!\" he managed to yell out in between coughs. \nHer expression darkened, and her foot raised up a few inches, looming over him. He scrambled backwards as best he could, sneaking out from under it just as it slammed back down. \"Did you just interrupt me?\" she asked. She didn't seem to care that he wasn't under her foot for the question.\n\"My name is Aaron,\" he answered, finally catching his breath and averting his eyes.\n\"You didn't answer my question. Did you just interrupt me?\"\nHe eyed her foot, he had just gotten out in time; if his legs had been straight, they would have been caught under her toes. \"I did,\" he admitted.\n\"And what do we say?\"\nHe looked up at her, puzzled. Her expression was expectant, but patient, like a parent teaching a child. \"Sorry?\" he guessed.\n\"There we go.\" In a sudden, dizzying motion, she leaned down and plucked him off the table. He fit wholly inside her fist, but she let his head poke out as she brought him up to her face. God, her face was massive, it seemed to consume his entire field of vision, even though she held him up at arm's length. Her pale blue eyes drew all his attention, even though her substantial breasts were just a brief glance downwards. \"Well, Aaron,\" she began, a slight smile on her face that brought out the dimples on her cheeks, \"My name is Suzy. And that,\" she continued, pointing over his shoulder. Aaron wasn't able to twist around enough to see what she was pointing at, but he knew it was the black giantess, \"Is my Mistress, Dominique.\"\nAaron didn't respond, not really sure what to say. Suzy's unmoving smile seemed to grow sinister as she continued, \"I'm told you made your Mistress unhappy. Now, I know how to keep my Mistress happy, so now I get to teach you.\"\nAaron's eyes widened, fear taking over again. Suzy's massive smile broadened, her nose wrinkling, \"Oh, we're going to have so much fun!\"\n \n \n Emma was only really able to hear Suzy's side of the exchange, and even her voice was faint, but she was impressed. She was effortlessly cruel, but did it without seeming sadistic. She hadn't had to push more than a few seconds to get the tiny man's name out of him, but Emma only heard it when she repeated it back to him.\nAaron. She didn't really know what she expected, but it wasn't that. Seemed kind of generic.\n\"Emma,\" Dominique said.\nEmma's head snapped up from the exchange between the two shrunken toys. Dominique nodded her head towards the kitchen. \"Want a cuppa?\"\n\"I'll get it,\" she said, stepping away from the table, sweeping her clothes up from the ground as she made her way to the kitchen. She wasn't all that uncomfortable with nudity, but it was cold, and she felt like an unkind guest with her bare ass on Dominique's chairs.\n\"Wait, mistress!\" called a tiny voice from the table. She twisted and saw Suzy at the edge, clutching the tiny man; Aaron; to her breast as if in prayer. \"Could you make him a little bigger?\"\n\"Er... How big?\"\n\"About twice as big as me. And freeze him please.\"\n\"Suzy...\" Dominique said, her tone a warning.\n\"Sorry, ma'am. I won't...\"\n\"No, it's fine,\" said Emma. She did it, frezing him first then growing him, slowly enough that the tiny woman could notice that it was happening and pitch him towards the center of the table, then stride calmly after him. Emma didn't care to watch, making her way to the kitchen, her clothes bundled up in her hands. She heard the screeching of the Dominique's chair sliding back from the table, and the other woman followed her into the kitchen, stepping carelessly over her own clothes. Her comfort with being naked was another thing that made Emma uncomfortable about it, how many surfaces on this house had held Dominique's bare ass?\n\"She showed her cards a bit early,\" Dominique confided, grabbing the carton of milk from the fridge while Emma put her underwear on. \"He's not supposed to know that we can't control his size.\"\n\"So what do you normally do?\" Emma asked.\n\"I'll draw up a timetable for you,\" replied Dominique, with a tone like it was the most normal thing in the world. \"Sizes and times. We work around it.\"\n\"Christ. How many times have you done this?\"\n\"Oh,\" Dominique rocked her weight from leg to leg a bit, her expression thoughtful as she prepared the tea, \"I think we've used the timetables eight times now.\"\nEmma just shook her head, stunned. \"How many customers do you know?\"\n\"I don't think you want the answer to that question, love,\" Dominique replied with a half-grin. \n \n \n \n \n Aaron soared across a seemingly infinite expanse of wood, his body growing even as he hurtled through the air. When he hit, it drove the air out of his lungs, and he rolled a few times before coming to rest on his back.\nHe couldn't move. Fuck. But he could feel the subtle vibrations though the wood as the other shrunken toy, Suzy, walked up to him. Eventually, her face appeared over his, and he was stunned by how small she seemed now. He had heard her say how much she wanted Emma to grow him, but seeing it was an entirely different matter. Christ, she looked like a kid, but there was no child with that aggressively feminine body, or with that hungry, near-feral look in their eyes.\n\"Comfortable?\" she asked.\nHe drew a sharp, surprised breath at the feel of her hand on his cock. Her fingers were cool, but her touch was soft, and he started to stir immediately. She noticed, and grinned, \"Apparently.\"\nWithout delay, she swung her legs over his hips, and he felt the wet heat of her crotch against his. She started grinding her hips back and forth as his dick rapidly stiffined; he had no idea what she was up to right now, but his body responded automatically.\n\"Look,\" she ordered, grabbing his head with her hand and lifting it up. The sight was almost comical; she had to lean all the way forward and reach above her head to grab him, and he was so much wider than she was that her legs were almost in a full split on top of him.\nBut when she let go and straightened up, letting him see the sight of her naked crotch pressed over his dick, his head held its position. Interesting.\nShe lifted her hips, and his cock sprung up. She grabbed it with one hand; her thumb didn't even touch her other fingers; and spread her labia with her other hand. Then, slowly, she eased herself down. \nFuck, she was tight, and he had never felt so big. And that look on her face... What he wouldn't give to see that look on every girl's face when he slid it in.\nShe just slid further and further down. How the hell was she fitting it all? She was half his height, maybe less. She should have bottomed out halfway down, but she kept going. Finally, her hips settled down on his, and she gave him a sultry grin, her face already flushed. Had he made her come already?\nHer eyes rolled back and her mouth fell open as she started to rock her hips back and forth, but all he wanted to do was grab her waist and start fucking her. God, she was tight, and, maybe it was the lighting, but he could have sworn that he saw the bulge of his cock inside her as high up as her belly button. \nOh, Christ. That shouldn't be possible. Was that just another ridiculous power granted by being shrunk? What could she do to him, if his body would just stretch and bend to accomodate whatever she wanted?\nHe didn't want to think about it. He just watched Suzy, half his height but riding him with an air of absolute authority. She didn't even bother looking at him, her head lolling back as she kept grinding her hips back and forth.\nMaybe enough of this... But no. Only a few seconds later, she froze, letting out a gasp as her legs tightened and her vagina squeezed weakly around him. Her body quivered, and she struggled to draw breath for a moment, and then she relaxed, finally bringing her eyes down to look at him.\nStill fixing him with the same hungry smile, she slowly slid her hips up, up, and all the way off of him. His cock fell out of her and fell forward onto his stomach, still hard, still glistening, still unsatisfied. He let out a disappointed sigh through his nose as she shuffled up his body, still on her knees, never breaking eye contact. When she got to his chest, she stood up, positioned his face right between her legs, and came crashing down on top of him.\nShe pressed her entire weight onto his face, her thighs squeezing tight and her legs wrapped around each other behind his head. The smell of her pussy was strong enough that he could taste it, but it was nothing compared to being trapped for days inside a woman's vagina. At least now he wasn't expected to eat her out as she rode his face, and he was suddenly grateful that she hadn't finished him off. \nHe just lay there, timing his breathing with the movement of her hips as she rode them roughly over his face, over and over. He got brief glimpses of her body, but her breasts were in the way of her face. All things considered, it wasn't a bad view, but then her pussy slid right over his face and all he could see was the pink, soaking-wet skin.\nIt took a while, especially since he wasn't helping, but she never seemed to tire of it. In fact, she seemed to enjoy it. He could hear her pleasured gasps, feel her thighs squeeze harder around his head. Her hands, tangled in his relatively short hair, gripped tight.\nFuck, woman. Just give me something. The stench of her pussy filling his nostrils, the weight and heat of her pressing down on his face, it all made his dick so hard it hurt. Finally, after what felt like an hour, she finally stopped, wriggling her hips over his mouth one last time like she wanted him to start licking. But, of course, he couldn't, so she unwrapped her legs from around his head and stood up.\n\"What, you didn't finish?\" she asked, sounding almost genuinely surprised and breathing heavy. Her hair was a mess and her face was flushed. A huge wet stain spread out from her crotch to almost a third of the way down her thigh.\nJust touch it. He begged. He'd practically explode with just one stroke. She slowly backed up, step by step, locking eyes with him, until she was right over it. \"Oh, that's a shame,\" she said.\nShe looked down at it, legs spread wide, looked back at him, looked back down at it again, then brought one leg back and delivered a rapid kick right between his legs.\nHe screamed. No, he couldn't scream. But he could swear he was screaming anyway. His body folded like a lawn chair and he brought his hands between his legs, whimpering like a baby. No, he couldn't move. He couldn't even make a sound. He just lay there, his breath shaking pitifully through his nose. Oh God... Oh God, oh God, oh God...\n\"You don't make your mistress happy,\" she said, planting a foot on his bare stomach. He recoiled at her touch, but his body didn't move. “And that doesn’t make me happy.”\nShe stood up, pressing all her weight down on his belly. He should’ve tensed his stomach, but he couldn’t, and so her foot sank far too deep in. It felt almost like getting kicked in the balls again. His eyes bulged and his breath was rapid, the only signs of pain he could give out. She took a step forward, and blessedly put her weight down on his ribcage. He could barely breathe with her standing there, but it was better.\nShe bent at the waist, bringing her face close to his. Her black hair hung down around her face, seeming to obscure the outside world, and all he could see was her piercing blue eyes. “I can do this forever,” she whispered. “It will never stop hurting. It will never get better. I will never get bored of it.”\nShe stood up and got off his chest. He took a deep, relieved breath, but, before he knew it, her foot was resting lightly on his crotch. It was cold, he could feel it. His dick was soft already, no surprise, and it felt like it shrank at her touch. She hadn’t put any weight down, not yet, just staring at him. Still, he breathed hard, in and out, through his nostrils, waiting for the wash of pain.\n“You’re a toy,” she said, matter of factly. “You know what people do when their toy stops working?”\nShe lifted her foot and brought it stomping down. Pain blinded him for a long moment. He couldn’t close his eyes, but the entire world seemed to go red. He felt almost like he had passed out. When he came to, though, he wasn’t curled up in a ball, clutching his testicles. He was still lying there, staring at a woman half his height who had reduced him to tears.\nHe was crying, wasn’t he. He felt the tears on his cheeks.\nShe shrugged. “People replace them,” she continued. “But what do you do with the old one?” A half-grin reappeared on her face. “You give it away. You can’t be un-shrunk, so where do you go?”\nShe pushed her weight down, just a little bit, just enough that he could feel it. His breath grew quicker again, panicked, and she stopped. Her grin split into a full smile; gone was the humble slave to the black giantess, and gone was the horny young woman who had face-fucked his immobile body. Behind that smile was a psychopath.\n“You serve your mistress,” she said softly. “Or you serve me.\"\n","Suzy had given this same speech so many times that she could do the whole thing, all the dramatic gestures and cruel torture, without even thinking about it. But that wasn't to say it was boring; she loved to see the looks on their faces, the desperation as they realized what they were, the helplessness as they waited for that second kick... She loved her Mistress, and she would have been happy to live a life where her only duty was to pleasure the woman. However, in her boundless kindness, Dominique had given her an even greater task, and there was no way for her to express her gratitude for that gift. No way, except to perform her duty faithfully.\nTwenty-three women and twelve men. She had broken thirty-five people, and little Aaron here; she still thought of him as 'little' even though he had been sized up to be fully twice her size; was going to be number thirty-six. The thirteenth man, too. Lucky him.\nWhy women preferred to have other women as sentient sex toys was a mystery to her; her Mistress said that the curves of her body 'felt better going in,' but what did that matter when she had absolute control over her size? What she did know, however, was that men were far and away more fun for her to break. Sure, the pattern of pain, pleasure, and deprivation was more or less the same, but the process was so much more rewarding. \nSure, men resisted harder, or at least they tried to, but breaking them was easy; put just a little bit of pressure between their legs, or even just threaten to, and they'd fold like a lawn chair. She'd have this Aaron trembling like an abused puppy in just a few short days. Shit, he was almost there now, and it had hardly been five minutes. But the real challenge wasn't in breaking the men, it was in building them up again.\nA broken toy was about as useful as a vibrator without batteries. The real key was in what you did after you broke them; when they felt like they had nothing to live for, you had to inspire them with a newfound sense of purpose. With women, it was downright easy. Any woman would suffer the demanding rigor and the degrading conditions of being a sex toy when they found solace in the deeply intimate relationship between their mistress and themselves. Once Suzy got them over their personal pride, and taught them as much as she could about how to please a woman, all she and Dominique had to do was seem unimpressed by their efforts. In a week's time, they'd be able to turn over a willing slave, eager to please just for the taste of acknowledgement.\nMen were more difficult. Sex wasn't an expression of emotional attachment to them, it was a primal urge. And, for all the stereotypical talk about men wanting to have sex all the time, the fact was that a man's drive was less a part of his life than a woman's was of hers. They were capable of anything if they were horny enough, but they were useless otherwise, and no woman wanted to wait for their sex toy to be 'in the mood.' That presented Suzy with a unique challenge.\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but the near-constant stimulation of being a sex toy, spending every waking moment buried between a woman's legs, breathing nothing but the heat and the scent of her, actually seemed to suppress most men's sex drive. Suzy had tried everything to keep it stoked, thinking that she could force their bodies to adapt to a life of constant sexual excitement, and that it would make them yearn for the time when they were called to please their mistress. Her methods ranged from systematic deprivation to basically raping them six times a day. She tried to tease out their fetishes, reprogram them to think that there was nothing hotter than being slave to a giantess, but nothing seemed to work. Eventually, their bodies refused to continue feeding their hormone-fueled libido, and they defaulted back to rebelliousness, or, more often, useless passivity.\nEventually, the successful method was to make them believe that being a willing, capable sex toy was their purpose in life. Rather than fabricate an emotional attachment or try to sustain their sex drive, she appealed to their sense of duty; they didn't have to enjoy what they did, it only mattered that their mistress did.\nIt seemed cliche. It seemed like stereotypical psuedo-psychology ripped from the pages of 'Men are From Mars, Women are from Venus,' but it worked. It felt cheap, and Suzy thought it lacked the subtlety of how she brought women around to be willing servants, but she wouldn't deny its effectiveness. Maybe there was something else going on there, some more nuanced line of thought going on in men's brains for which her drill sergeant routine was just a convenient springboard. Whatever the case, it worked, and it worked a bit faster than her process did with women, even though it did require more of her and her Dominique's attention.\nSince she first figured it out, they had only had to reset two men's memories. The first, her guinea pig, who had completly built up a resistance to her thanks to her failed efforts, and the seventh, who had been reduced to a crying, quivering mess by months of his mistress' torture beforehand. She was confident in her abilities now, but she was uncertain whether she would be successful with Aaron. Emma had kept him for a while now, and Dominique had described the things that the other giantess had done to him. Arbitrary, ill-timed blending of cruelty and reward that wouldn't really do anything but confuse her toy, or even make him outright hostile with enough time.\nIt was going to be hard to figure him out, especially since he probably had buried his sense of rebellion good and deep. If Suzy had the choice, she'd just wipe the little man and start fresh, but she would obey the orders of her mistress regardless of her opinions.  \nShe eyed the little man beneath her, her foot pressing delicately against the soft flesh between his legs, savoring the fear in his face. He couldn't move, he couldn't even twitch an eye, but the terror was still there, clear as day. His chest heaved with his panicked breathing. \n\"You serve your mistress,\" she whispered, her face a mask of sadistic cheerfulness, \"Or you serve me.\"\nThat was it, the crescendo. Aaron's breath, rapid and fearful, stopped fast. He looked like a deer caught in headlights, frozen in terror as death sped towards it, and Suzy's smile broadened. \nShe let him marinate on that statement for a minute, staring at him the entire time, then pushed just a little harder down on his groin. His quick, panicked breath resumed, waiting for her to put all of her weight down, and then she made a show of thinking twice about it. She drew her bare foot back, then planted it square on his belly.\nWhen she put her weight down, it drove the air out of his lungs, and his eyes widened slightly, as much as was possible with his movement frozen. She brought her other leg forward and stood, feet together, hands on naked hips, on his stomach. The flesh underneath yielded far too much, but he couldn't tense his abdominal muscles to support her weight. She was half his height, and so, in normal terms, she barely weighed forty pounds to his two hundred, but it clearly still hurt.\nShe broke eye contact to flick her hair back carelessly. \"It's your choice, I suppose,\" she said in an airy voice. \"I hope you make the right one. I would just love a new toy to play with.\"\nThe dull thudding of full-sized feet hitting the ground rapidly approached the room, and Suzy whipped her head around in time to see Emma leaving the kitchen, fully clothed, followed by Dominique, stark naked. Emma passed by the table without so much as glancing down at them, and Suzy leaned down, whispering conspiratorily to the frozen little man. \"Oh, look, she's leaving you with us! Isn't that exciting?\"\n\"Thanks again, Dominique,\" Emma said, her hand on the doorknob.\n\"Not a problem, really.\"\n\"No, I mean it.\"\nDominique tilted her head down and gave Emma that sultry, half-sarcastic gaze that Suzy loved so much. \"Love, you're embarassing yourself.\" She looked away and flicked her wrist, gesturing for Emma to leave. \"Go.\"\nEmma giggled, turning the doorknob and stepping outside. At the last second, she called, \"Love you, Dom!\" Then she shut the door.\nThe smile on Dominique's face was genuine, and Suzy was genuinely happy to see it. She fell to her knees on top of the shrunken man's chest, grabbed his face between her hands, and twisted it so that he could see. \"Look,\" she whispered into his ear. \"See how happy she is? Why isn't your mistress that happy?\" She jerked his head forward again, staring directly into his eyes. \"Because you failed,\" she said, her voice verging on anger.\nWith that, she straightened up and took a step back, planting her right foot square on top of the tiny man's junk. She put all her weight on it before he could even react, and she could practically feel the pain radiating from his body. She lingered there for a moment, balanced on one leg, the man's testicles holding her entire weight from beneath the arch of her foot, then stepped off of him, turning to face her mistress as her booming foosteps drew up to the table.\n\"Suzy,\" she snapped. \"We need to talk.\"\nSuzy let her eyes drop, folding her arms in front of her. \"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\"To the edge.\"\nSuzy hurried forward to the end of the table, her toes curling over the edge, \"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\"Get ready.\"\nSuzy merely nodded at this, and she started to grow immediately. Rapidly. In seconds, she was at her full height, sitting on the table. She hopped down and returned to her submissive stance. \"Grab the boy,\" Dominique said. \"We need to speak privately.\"\n\"Yes ma'am,\" Suzy replied. She span around and scooped the tiny man up from the table. He recoiled a bit as her hand wrapped around him; so Becca had unfrozen him; but there was nothing he could do to resist her. Just a few seconds ago, he had been twice her height, but now he fit comfortably in her fist. She lifted her leg up onto the table, spread open her vulva with her free hand, and effortlessly slid the tiny man into her vagina, feet-first.\n So much happened all at once. Suddenly, Suzy had grown into a godess, and, just as soon as he learned that he could move again, he was wrapped up in her hand, traveling towards her crotch at a terrifying speed. Her forefinger and middlefinger pressed against the flesh, parting the lips of her labia and revealing the bright pink underneath. The flesh was smooth, almost impossibly so, with not a hair in sight, and, before he knew what was happening, his feet were sunk up to his knees in the hot flesh.\nHe struggled fiercely, but he couldn't even free his arms from the woman's grip, and he only had a second before her hand pushed against his head and shoved his entire body inside her. He watched the bright pink, tight walls of her vagina part beneath him, seemingly infinite in their depth, before his feet hit something hard and he stopped.\nHe looked up... or was it down? And all he saw was more of the same, the tight, muscular walls of the woman's vagina squeezing together just over the tiny pocket of space that surrounded his head. A watertight seal, apparently, beacase, as lubricant slowly eked from the walls around him, his tiny bubble of air started to fill with fluid. He squirmed, and was able to get some of it to drain away, but more came from above, and soon it covered his eyes and his nose.\nHe took his last few breaths of air; it was hot, and it reeked of the fishy, fleshy smell of the woman's vagina, but it was air; and then his next breath drew down a lungful of steaming-hot, sticky lubricant. Maybe it was a sign of how helpless his situation had become, but he didn't even cough as the thick fluid entered his lungs. \nHis balls still ached, and he was still acutely aware of the fact that he was trapped inside the body of his torturer. God only knew what she had planned for him, but he knew that he wouldn't like it.\nEmma had given him to this woman, this fucking monster, for training, as if she was dropping off a disobedient pet at Doggy Daycare. Well, he would show her. He would pass this shit with flying colors, he would prove himself a loyal servant, and then, once he earned her trust, he would fucking ruin her.\n \nAlone in Dominique's apartment, she and Suzy could dispense with the formalities of mistress and toy. No need for submissive gestures, reverent titles, or unquestioning obedience. No need for disparate size or for the pointed symbolism of who deserved clothes and who didn't. Suzy sat in a chair at the dinner table, her legs crossed and a cup of hot tea in her hands, and Dominique leaned up against the table, naked as the day she was born, sipping on a cup of the same tea. Suzy wore a pair of her own underwear, but that was only to provide an extra layer of protection between the world and the shrunken man inside her. \nHe couldn't hear them, at least not to the point that he could distinguish words, and nobody else could see them, so there was no reason to demonstrate who was in charge. They both knew their place, and they were both abundantly comfortable with it.\nBut, even so, there were some parts of their relationship that drove deeper than theatre, so Dominique had to lead the discussion. \"So, Suzy, what do you think?\"\n\"About what, ma'am?\"\nDominique tilted her head down, leveling a stern look at Suzy. \"Really?\"\nThe other woman giggled, \"I'm sorry, I just wanted to see that look.\"\nDominique let herself crack a smile, closing her eyes and shaking her head. \"But honestly, Suzy, what do you think?\"\nSuzy turned the cup of tea between her hands thoughtfully. \"I think... I think it's going to be hard.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nSuzy nodded. \"He's stubborn, and what Emma did to him didn't do us any favors, either.\"\n\"So do we need to break him harder, or spend more time building him up?\"\n\"Break him, probably,\" Suzy replied uncertainly. \"But, even then, I think he might internalize it. If we push too hard, he'll resent us even more.\"\n\"So what do you recommend?\"\n\"Wipe him,\" answered Suzy. She spoke with absolute conviction. \"This will only work with a fresh slate.\"\n\"Hm...\" Dominique took a thoughtful sip of her tea. She trusted Suzy's judgement in this, but there was more at play here than even Suzy could know. Emma was her friend, but the revelation that she had acquired a shrunken toy was a shock, to say the least. Still, she had specifically requested that her toy not have his memory wiped, and there was an opportunity there that she dared not speak of. \"Could you do it without wiping him?\" she asked.\n\"Probably, but...\" Suzy looked like she was about to continue, then fell short with a frustrated sigh.\n\"But what?\" Dominique asked patiently.\n\"I'm worried that he'll just pretend to go along,\" Suzy said, avoiding eye contact for a reason that had nothing to do with their relationship. She was proud of her work, and she was afraid to admit that she might be falling short of success. \"He'll fake it until we're done with him, and then he'll betray Emma.\"\n\"She has total control over his body,\" Dominique said pointedly. \nSuzy nodded, setting the teacup down on the table. Then, moving so violently that the chair underneath her went flying back, she suddenly had Dominique by the throat, their lips pressed forcefully together. Dominique's teacup was squished between their bodies, a thin trickle of hot tea dribbling down her belly. Her eyes widened in shock, then rolled back in pleasure as Suzy placed her other hand on the back of her head and pulled her forward, probing the inside of her mouth with her tongue.\nThen, as soon as it started, it was over. Suzy pulled back, eyeing Dominique's body lustily, then she patiently recovered her chair and sat down in it. She crossed her legs, grabbed her teacup, and said, \"Now imagine if I had a knife.\"\nDominique's hands were shaking a bit. Who exactly was in charge here? She set down the cup and folded her hands in front of her. \"Okay...\" she said. \"We're going to try it anyway. But you let me know if anything seems funny.\"\nSuzy nodded. \"Yes, ma'am.\"\n \n","Aaron hung there, upside-down inside Suzy, with the blood pooling in his head, for God only knew how long. He didn't even bother struggling; he knew from experience that he wouldn't be able to do much against the relentless pressure of the woman's vagina. Through the tons and tons of throbbing flesh that surrounded him, he could feel the woman moving, and he could hear her speaking, but neither were distinct enough for him to make anything of it. The steady thump-thump of her heartbeat ruled his entire world.\nHe kicked half-heartedly against the walls that surrounded him, hoping to elicit a response, but nothing happened. He pawed against the hot flesh, trying to pull himself towards the exit, but he couldn't gain any purchase. He was trapped, well and good, waiting for this woman, Suzy, to decide what to do with him.\nFuck, his captor was a toy herself. Barely ten minutes ago, she had been half his height, but the black giantess had sought fit to grow her to full size, and now he was trapped inside her like a living tampon. The helplessness of it all was infurating, but there was nothing he could do at this scale to restore his status as a human being, no matter how loud he screamed or how hard he kicked.\nHe resented the fact that he resigned to this sense of helplessness so quickly; barely five minutes after he had been forgotten inside this new woman's body, he had stopped trying to worm his way to freedom, and he couldn't muster up the will to continue. He offered one last frustrated kick against the fleshy walls, but he couldn't gain the leverage to do anything but push ineffectually against the massive woman's insides, and it elicited no reaction.\nHe could feel her moving around, though. The steady, predictable pulse of her heartbeat throbbing against his body was mixed with the irregular thudding of her footsteps. He was rocked left and right by the steady motion of her walk, lifted up and down as she stood and sat. It didn't seem, at least from his limited perspective, that she was doing any aggressive acrobatics, but there was really no way to be sure from here.\nThe question that nagged at him, however, was whether he would shrink with her if the black giantess decided to shrink her toy back down. If he did, he might wind up smaller than a speck of dust, and an inopportune escape might leave him stuck at a size so small that nobody could ever see him. He imagined being sucked up unwittingly by a vaccum cleaner, tossed carelessly into the garbage and forgotten forever.\nHe didn't know. And, unless he was sure, he couldn't chance an escape attempt while with these women. He would have to wait it out, endure whatever torture they came up with, until he could return to Emma. But the dull ache that he still felt between his legs reminded him exactly how awful that could be. If Suzy was comfortable torturing him like that right in front of Emma, how much worse could she be when they were in private?\nMaybe getting tossed into the trash with a bunch of dust and crumbs was a better option.\n \nSuzy worked with her mistress for the better part of two hours to develop the size schedule they would send to Emma. She led the process, laying out exactly how she planned to break the little man and then build him up again. She even had the privilege of sitting at the computer as they worked, though Dominique loomed over her the entire time. The other woman had thrown on a sweatshirt as the warmth of the tea had worn off, but she was still naked below the waist, practically inviting a pleasurable distraction from the tedious work.\nShe had also shrunk Suzy. Not much, only a few inches. She probably thought that her loving toy wouldn't notice, but, when Suzy had another shrunken toy inside her, every inch lost made the tiny man that much bigger. Any size change sudden enough had the shocking sensation of penetration; it was almost impossible fokr her to miss. Ever since Dominique had done it, Suzy had been fighting back an insatiable sexual desire, waiting for the cue from her mistress to get the fun started. \nAbout an hour after they started, Dominique leaned in a bit too close to the computer screen, and Suzy reached up and brushed a soft kiss against her neck. Her mistress leaned into it, begging for more, and Suzy obliged, kissing and sucking gently at the smooth skin. She pulled away after only a few seconds, and saw that Dominique was already breathing heavy, her pulse pounding visibly in the veins of her neck. \nHer mistress took the next move faster than she could have hoped. Her hand was on the back of Suzy's head before she even knew what was happening, and she dragged her forward, forcing their lips together. Suzy was elated, but not too surprised, to feel their tongues start worming together, and she reached back with her right hand and probed her way up the other woman's thigh. She reached the heat of her crotch almost effortlessly, and started to rub carefully at the sensitive flesh.\nDominique gasped into her mouth, her tongue still probing at Suzy's. It was a deeply satisfying sound. Her job momentarily forgotten, Suzy spun around in her chair to face her mistress, bringing her other hand to the woman's neck. They both breathed desperately around each other, greedily sucking down the heat and the scent of one another. Their making out grew more and more furious, until Suzy found herself standing up from her chair, her middle two fingers knuckle-deep in her mistress' vagina, and the sweater discarded on the floor.\nThere was nothing between them but heat. Suzy could barely tell where her flesh ended and Dominique's began. But her insistent pressure slowly drove both of them to the ground, legs tied up in knots, their mouths seemingly melted together. Eventually, though, Suzy felt an insistent, downward pressure on the top of her head. She raised her gaze to meet Dominique's, and saw a carnal hunger in her eyes.\nShe obeyed without question, delaying her downwards journey slightly to graze her teeth against her mistress' tender nipples, to lay gentle kisses on her taut stomach. Every brush of her lips was rewarded with goosebumps, nearly-invisible peach fuzz standing on end in the chill air. Soon, though, she was between Dominique's thighs, staring up at a beautiful expanse of flesh, meeting the other woman's eyes over the mound of her breasts. She greeted the other woman's lusty gaze eagerly, breathing deep of the familiar, heady smell of her most intimate parts. \nAfter as much finger teasing as she dared, she clamped her mouth down on Dominique's pussy. Her mistress let out a pleasured gasp immediately, but Suzy knew that it would be a while before she was finally satisfied.\nThere was a bit of tedium in this, she had to admit. She spent the next few minutes drawing circles over Dominique's clitoris with her tongue, a rote exercise that was repetitive enough for her mind to start wandering. But she loved hearing Dominique gasp, her hands grasping desperately at her breasts. She loved watching her hips buck and squirm, unwittingly seeking relief from the unceasing stimulation. However repetitive it was, it was worth it.\nAfter riding the familiar rhythms of pleasure for the better part of fifteen minutes, Dominique finally came. Her entire body tightened up, thighs squeezing hard around Suzy's head, fingers gripping white-knuckled at her hair. She could hear her mistress gasping desperately for breath during that one, brief moment where her mind touched heaven.\nIn that moment, Suzy wanted nothing more than to be inside her. The insistent force of Dominique's hands drawing her forward, of her thighs trying to pop her head open like a grape, it was nothing compared to the comforting heat and pressure of her vagina. Suzy had endured countless orgasms under the strength of the giantess' pelvic muscles. Even where she was, with her mouth filled with the taste of Dominique's pussy and her head crushed between the vice grip of her legs, was a pale imitation of being there to experience the climax. \nOnly there, with her entire body buried inside the warm blanket of Dominique's flesh, could she feel like she was truly a part of her mistress' ecstasy. She thought, briefly, about the little man who was inside her, little Aaron, who surely wondered why the heartbeat that pulsed against every inch of his skin was so rapid right now. Did he know what that overriding, primal sense of empathy felt like? Could he ever know what it felt like to be connected to someone, body and soul?\nAnd then Dominique finally came down. A deeply satisfied, half-screaming moan escaped her lips, almost but not quite formed into a coherent curse of pleasure. Her chest heaved, gasping down air, and her hips bucked up and down, carrying Suzy with them. Her legs were relentless, squeezing like they meant to pop her head like a walnut, but Suzy just waited it out, satisfied with her work. She sucked and licked tenderly at the flesh beneath her mouth, trying to keep her mistress going for as long as she could without being overwhelming. \nShe was rewarded, after about sixty seconds, by Dominique pushing her away, her legs clamping shut and twisting away to keep her from doing anything more. Suzy was a bit disappointed, but satisfied in her work. She lay there, watching Dominique's entire body writhing about as she rode out the last remnants of her orgasm, savoring that expression of pure pleasure as proof of a job well done.\nFinally, her mistress' entire body relaxed. Her legs fell askew, and she propped herself up on her elbows. Her dark skin made it hard to tell, but her face was flushed with pleasure. Her hair was a mess, and sweat beaded up on her forehead despite the cool air. She smiled broadly down at Suzy, full lips parting to reveal brilliantly white teeth. Suzy couldn't help but return the smile. \nThey met each other's gaze for a moment, then Dominique let her head fall back, and she let out the first coherent word of the last fifteen minutes. \n\"Fuck!\"\nSuzy giggled. She scooted forward to lay her chin on Dominique's hips, her head square between her legs. \"I want to be in there,\" she said.\n\"Mmm, I know you do,\" Dominique replied, reaching her right hand down to run her fingers through Suzy's hair. She felt her mistress' fingers brush a smear of fluid away from her mouth with her thumb. \"I want you in there too, but we have a job to do.\"\n","Aaron spent hours, maybe even days buried in a world of hot, wet flesh. The pounding heatrbeat of his captor was the only way he could keep time, but the rhythm was so chaotic that it was useless. Occasionally, it was slow, and his fleshy prison was perfectly still. Sometimes, it was rapid, and his entire world was rocked back and forth in a chaotic wirlwind of unpredictable motion. From where he lay, Suzy's normal activities were a stomach-churning roller-coaster, and there was no chance to get off that ride.Was it hours? Was it days? Was it weeks? He was wrapped from head to toe in tight, muscular flesh, a thick layer of salty lubricant covering every inch of his body. The viscous fluid flowed in and out of his lungs with every breath. He was a slave, an involuntary toy for this woman, and the real insult was that this woman was herself a tiny sex slave.Where did it end? Would he find a bite-sized toy somewhere in this woman's vagina? How many layers down did the Matryoshka doll go? There was no answer to that question, but the end to his fluid-soaked sexual torture came quite abruptly. A giant pair of fingers grabbed his head, and, in a quick, violent motion, he was dragged out into the bright light and cool air of the real world.He hit the ground so hard the air was driven from his lungs, a fall that he knew should have killed him, if the woman didn't already tear her head off by yanking him out like that. He stared up at the spread legs of the massive woman that had torn him from her vagina, until she stepped to the side and looked disdainfully down at his flushed, wet body.A massive, pale woman, stark-naked with bright blue eyes and dark brown nipples set in the middle of her tight breasts, seemed to regard him with the same care as he would an ant in his kitchen. With the expression on her face, he honestly expected her to lift her foot and stamp on him like he was no more than a bug, but she didn't. She just stared down at him, and her gaze bore such weight that he couldn't meet it for long. He climbed to his feet, moving slow, waiting for the sole of her foot to come crashing down on top of him just as he started to recover. But it didn't happen. Finally, he made his way to his feet, and found, to his surprise, that Suzy was no longer a goddess of incomprehensible size. Based on a quick observation of his surroundings, he had not grown, but she had shrunk, and now she was a little less than twice his height. When he looked, his eyes were at a level with her belly-button. It was easier to look up at a gaze that was only a few feet above his, but the experience was somehow more intimidating than the stare of a hundred foot-tall giantess.Finally, she spoke. \"Do you know why you're here?\" she asked.Aaron didn't dare respond. There may have been a right answer to the question, but there were far more wrong answers, and he didn't want to invoke the punishment of the wrong answer, not from this woman who seemed to delight in torturing him. He broke eye contact and looked down at his feet.In response, the massive woman crouched down, bringing her head level to his, and placed her hand under his chin. The size of her fingers relative to his head was not lost on him as he looked into her massive eyes; she could have gripped his head like a grapefruit. She spoke again, her voice overwhelming despite her soft tone, \"Tell me, why do you think you're here?\"With her banana-sized fingers holding his jaw, he couldn't look away from those massive, blue eyes. There was no nuance of her expression that escaped his notice at this range, and she seemed honestly curious, if a bit disdainful. He tried to ignore the condescension in her gaze and answered honestly, \"You want to train me...?\"She heard the question in his voice, and her gaze narrowed. There was no hostility in her expression, though. She straightened up, keeping one hand outstretched, an invitation to maintain eye contact as she answered his question, \"Almost,\" she said.Her face hardened quite abruptly and she continued. \"You are worth nothing. You have been chosen as your mistress' servant, but you were a day away from being discarded as useless. You are here to learn how to be useful, otherwise... You're just trash.\"She said that last bit so flippantly that it sent chills down his spine. Trash? At this insignificant size, what the fuck did that mean? Emma proved that he could be restored to his full size, but also proved that he could be shrunken down to fish food. If he was tossed away by that giantess forever, he had a good idea of which size he would be when he was flushed down the drain.As if she heard his thoughts, Suzy bent forwards at the waist, bringing her head down towards his. He couldn't help but notice how her breasts sagged as she did so, but the sheer bulk of her form was so intimidating that it made it seem like her body was closing in on him. \"Oh, don't fret, I'm sure I'd play with you for a while first,\" she said with a wicked smile. She brought one of her massive hands down and stroked his face with her thumb. He recoiled instinctively, and her smile broadened.\"I'd love a new toy,\" she said thoughtfully, her eyes wandering upwards. She bit her lower lip, and her grin grew before she looked back down at him. He could see the hunger in her eyes as she stroked his face again. In that moment, he felt real fear, a fear that froze him in his place. This woman was in the perfect position to arbitrarily decide that he deserved to be her slave, and the memory of what she had done to him was still fresh in his mind. It was the last thing he wanted, but he couldn't say that aloud.\"You wouldn't be the first,\" she promised, her voice growing husky. The lust in her face was as plain as day now, and her thumb continued to stroke the side of his face. He was only vaguely aware of how the rest of her hand had curled around his back. \"The lazy ones, the disobedient ones... the ones I just wanted to play with...\"\nShe leaned in a little closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"They defied me,\" she said, practically moaning, \"I showed them the consequences after their mistresses abandoned them.\"Suzy's hand wrapped a little tighter around his back, and she drew a sharp, shaky breath before leaning down to whisper directly into his ear, bleeding sensuality as she continued, \"Do it for me,\" she said. \"Fight back, refuse your place. I'll show you what it means to be a toy.\"Faced with the massive figure of her body, frozen by the goosebump-raising tone of her voice, Aaron couldn't bear to turn his head to look the woman in the eye. Then, without warning, he felt the hot, wet mass of her tongue against the side of his head. Not a full lick, just a little brush, but he recoiled all the same. Suzy straightened up, a satisfied look on her face, and Aaron just stood there, trembling. The thick layer of saliva on his left ear was chilling in the open air.    Trying to quell his fear, he looked up at Suzy, though his instinct screamed to avoid eye contact. She was already looking down at him, and it took every last fiber of his being to keep from breaking eye contact and fixing his gaze on his feet. The sexual sight of her tight, muscular body didn't even command his attention anymore; all he felt was fear.Then, without warning, she grabbed the back of his head and drew him abruptly forwards. At the same time, she fell to her knees. His face was buried in her crotch, and his body was forced down to the ground. In less than a second, her entire weight was borne on her groin, which sat directly on top of his face. The pink, wrinkled flesh of her vulva was all he could see, the warm, fishy scent was all he could smell. Aaron half expected her to start grinding on him again, facefucking his tiny body like she had before. But she just held him there, pressing his face against the soft flesh between her legs. Far above him, he could hear her taunting voice, muffled from between her massive thighs. \"You like that?\" she asked. \"Get used to the taste. It's gonna be your life if you fuck this up.\"Then she finally drew her pussy off his face. Knees on the ground, she walked herself backwards until her face was at a level with his. Her flushed face was the picture of lust, and her flared nostrils showed that she was ready to take this entire situation to its logical conclusion. Eyes sparkling, she leaned forwards and planted her lips on Aaron's. Her mouth was just barely large enough to consume Aaron's head whole, but she acted for all the world like a horny teenager. Her tongue shoved its way between his lips, greedily slurping up the hot, viscous mix of his saliva and the fluid from her own vagina. It felt like trying to deepthroat a T-bone steak. Aaron had to fight to keep from gagging, afraid that she would interpret it as a sign of rejection.Finally, she detatched from his face and stood up straight. All he could do was watch her perfect figure step off of him and wipe his face with the back of his hand. He was too stunned, too afraid to do anything else. Finally, she turned her back on him, making to walk away, before, at the last moment, she turned back and said, \"Don't disappoint me.\"\nHoly shit. Things had just gotten serious.\n","Dominique had watched the entire thing from the corner of the room. At his size and in his position, the shrunken man stood no chance of noticing her until she intentionally presented herself, so she could observe Suzy do her work. And she did not disappoint. This whole part of the routine was the good-cop-bad-cop bit, and, at least this early, it worked for both men and women. It had to be tailored a bit, obviously, depending on the subject, but she trusted Suzy to set the stage.And she was in rare form today. Her performance was so convincing that Dominique wasn't quite sure it was just a performance. She could hear every word her little toy said, and she could see enough of what she did to wonder whether or not Suzy's 'bad cop' act was actualy an act. For all the people she had broken, she had never been anything but professional, but this seemed like something else.Maybe she was imagining things. Suzy finished her routine and walked away from the stunned shrunken man, striding casually off the edge of the table and onto the pillow that waited below; she had to disappear, but the shrunken toy couldn't hear the sound of the tiny woman's body hitting the floor. Dominique drew a breath and set herself in the mindset of the careless dominatrix, the woman who made a business turning living people into broken, willing sex toys.She walked towards the table, clothed in nothing but her underwear, with utter confidence. Despite her experience, it took a bit of effort to exude that air of pure fearlessness of whatever judgement her shrunken audience could pass on her body. She had done this so many times, and there were so many men and women out there who had seen her like this, and it was still a challenge. Doubly so now, with the stakes as high as they were with this particular contact.No, her appearance wasn't important, but how she treated the tiny man, in this delicate stage, was crucial. She had actually learned quite a bit from Suzy in this respect; she had to treat them like they wanted to be a sex toy, like it was something they should strive for. After some experimentation, somewhat unintuitively, the message was best communicated in skimpy garb, rather than fully-clothed or even in the nude. Frankly, she didn't like it, but she accepted it as part of the cost for letting her own shrunken toy manage the training the process.But, with Aaron specifically, there was nuance. She couldn't afford to make him her enemy. She could lean into the 'good-cop' bit, but she could not let him develop any sense of distrust or resentment against her. Otherwise, everything would be ruined.\"Hey, you're finally awake,\" she said softly as she approached the table. \"Good to see you up. You feeling alright?\"She gave it a beat before she kept talking, but she didn't really bother waiting for a response. \"So I've heard that you've had trouble... You know... Getting your girl across the finish line,\" she said, letting the most passive-aggressive twist onto her face that she could muster. She saw the shift in his tiny face, confusion mixed with embarassment. That was a good sign. \"Don't worry about it,\" she continued in a consoling tone. \"Me and Suzy... We can fix that for you.\"She sat up on the table, which creaked notably under her weight. She couldn't help but notice that the shrunken man's eyes lingered on her ass as it spread out under her. She smiled; she had him right where she wanted him.\"Oh, come on,\" she said, her voice growing breathy, \"I'm sure you can show us what you're made of, right?\" She leaned down, not so far as to be imposing, but enough to drive the point home, \"Big guy like you, it doesn't matter how tall I am, does it? I bet you can make me come any time you get the chance.\"Dominique lowered her voice and leaned in just a bit more, her tone becoming almost conspiratorial, \"Suzy doesn't want you to beat this, but I think you're better than her. I'll be watching; if you can make her come, I'll give you a little treat.\"She stood straight up, a sultry smile on her lips. \"Yeah, I think you're good for this. The ones before you were trash, some of them were so bad that I just let Suzy keep them, but you're better than that, aren't you.\"It wasn't a question. It was a fact, a challenge. She left it at that, turning on her heel and walking out of the room, giving as much swagger to her step as possible. She knew that the Aaron's gaze was fixed on her jiggling, panty-clad ass; she could expect no less from a man. But she also knew that Suzy was about to punish him for it, so she felt a little guilty that she had let herself get involved at all.Aaron watched Dominique leave the room, enjoying the sight of her hips shifting back and forth as she walked away, but wondering what on earth was going on. Suddenly, a massive foot slammed down beside him, followed by another one on the other side. Each impact was so hard that was almost lifted straight off the ground, and he looked straight up to see the most incredible sight of his life.Suzy stood over him, in all her clean-shaven glory, at full human size. He hated that he thought of it that way, but it was the only way to describe it. He was barely as tall as her ankles, but she stood straddling his tiny body, her hips tilted back and her torso bent forwards. The massive, muscular columns of her legs led upwards for miles, ending finally at her wide hips. Between her legs, he could see the wrinkled brown flesh of her vulva, pointing up to a tight, flat stomach, an appetizing view from beneath her breasts and, finally, her stern and disappointing gaze.He immediately regretted the fact that he had allowed his eyes to travel so rudely up her body. He let his gaze fall as soon as he met her eyes and saw the look in them, waiting for the inevitable punishment. Maybe her weight would come crashing down on his head, maybe she'd shove him up her ass, or maybe she'd just straight-up eat him. Didn't matter at this point, did it? He was here for his 'reeducation,' and he had no say in how he was going to be treated for an indefinite amount of time.\"What are you looking at her like that for?\" a booming voice asked from above him. He looked up and saw Suzy's severe stare still fixed on him. \"What the hell would you do to her even if you had the chance?\"Suzy fell into a deep crouch, bringing her face down to meet him, along with a wash of the warm, fishy smell that emanated from between her legs. Her presence drew close to him in sight, sound, smell, and even the warmth of her body so rapidly that he couldn't suppress the fear that rose in his gut. She didn't seem to notice his eyes widen, or his brief attempt to scramble backwards.\"You had a gorgeous woman shove your entire body into her vagina, or nestle you right up against her clit, positions that any man in the world would envy,\" she said, sounding almost bored, \"You should have been able to control her like a puppet from there, and yet you did so poorly that she brought you here, to me.\"She looked up, her expression softening into disappointment. \"And you're ogling the woman who I love like you could do even half of what I do,\" she said. After a moment's thought, she looked back down, and let her ass fall to the surface of the table, shaking his world so hard that he was nearly lifted off the ground again. Even amidst the chaos of the moment, he couldn't help but notice how her breasts bounced when she hit the tabletop. Her legs stretched out, her thighs flatting against the hard wood of the table, and closed, her feet touching far behind him. Panic immediately set in as he realized that, at a whim, she could crush him with her legs. He couldn't escape even if he wanted to. He looked fearfully up at the massive woman, trying not to let his eyes drift down between her legs, where the dark, warm flesh of her labia hung invitingly over the twin globes of her ass that held it up. Her hips were tilted in such a way that he could almost barely see her asshole as well, and she was leaned so far back, her arms holding her weight behind her, that her face seemed a million miles away.He could absolutely still hear her voice, though, and her gaze was inescapable as she said, \"So you think you can please a woman like that, why don't you try to please a woman like me?\"He looked down at her pussy, nearly as tall as he was and almost so far off the ground that he couldn't reach it, then back up at her with disbelief. In response, she drew her feet a bit closer to her, spreading her ass enough to show the dark pucker of her anus, and opening the wrinkled flesh of her vulva just barely enough to reveal a sliver of the bright pink beneath. \"Yes, I'm serious,\" she purred. \"Show me what you're made of, little man. Maybe you can prove we should let you go right now.\"It was false hope, he knew it, but it still drew him forwards. The thick, heady smell drew stronger with every step, until he thought he'd choke on it. As he got closer, the nauseating smell of shit hit him as well, wafted up from her exposed asshole, creating a truly disgusting mix of body odors. He grit his teeth and accepted this as something he had to do if he wanted his freedom. The problem was that her pussy was too high up. God forbid she lean forwards and make it easy for him. He drew within arm's reach of the massive woman's crotch, contemplating how he could get up to really start working at her clit, when he heard the booming voice above him, \"Hey, I don't have all day.\"Fuck. Could he even win at this? He reached up and got both hands between the bottom of Suzy's labia. The flesh was soft, wet, and pliant, but he weighed so little that it barely moved for him. He was able to pull himself up enough to plant his bare feet on either side of the woman's vulva, wedged into the wrinkles between her thighs and her hips. If she opened her legs at that moment, he'd fall down. If she closed them, he'd be trapped. He just had to trust her goodwill, which he absolutely did not.He slid one of his arms deep between her labia, feeling the warm, wrinkled flesh of her vagina. He hoped that it would anchor him a little better and he could pull himself up, but it just made things worse. Miles above, Suzy giggled, and her entire body responded, the muscles of her vagina siezing rhythmically. Each pulse drew him further in, despite how hard he tried to pull out, until his entire arm was buried in her vagina, his shoulder lodged between her labia and his head turned outwards in an effort to keep breathing fresh air.Okay, so care was needed. Slowly, using the lips of her labia as leverage, he drew his arm out and started to climb further up. He heard a satisfied moan from the giantess, but it caused no motion in his narrow world of heat and hormones. After only one or two minutes, he got to the point that he could get his lips on the massive woman's clitoris, hidden though it was in her vulva. He was in a precarious position, but he had no choice, he had to make her come.So he planted his lips on what he hoped was Suzy's clit, and started going to work. He was so tiny that just licking wouldn't do it, he had to bite and chew; not hard enough to break the skin, but enough to at least dent the flesh. Hopefully, it would be enough stimulation to bring her to orgasm, and he'd just have to endure whatever her body did when she finally came.But nothing happened. After a long, painful sixty seconds, his arms shaking from the effort of holding him up, the massive woman sighed. The expression carried all the way down to him, nearly shaking him lose as her vagina clenched hard. She leaned forwards, and that did shake him lose. He hit the table beneath her just a second before her pussy came crashing down on top of him. All he could see was the soft pink flesh, all he could hear was her heartbeat, and all he could smell was fish.Great, he thought. If you wanted to come, you should have done this earlier.But her voice was still loud and clear. \"Was that it? You definitely got me horny, but you did nothing else?\"    She lifted herself up, just a bit, just enough that he could feel the fresh air and she could grab his fluid-smeared body out from underneath him. In a quick, stomach-churning motion, she drew him up right in front of her massive face. Her dark-brown eyes were as big as his head, and seemed to penetrate to his soul as she said, \"So all I want right now is to use you as a dildo.\" She bit her lip, desire bleeding into her expression, and she looked down, tilting him down as well, just enough that he could see the hot junction between her spread legs. \"Is that what you want?\" she asked, tilting him back up to look her in the eye again, \"You want to be a living aphrodesiac that occasionally gets used as a dildo? If that's so, we're done already. You're ready.\"She stared at him for a moment, and it took more than a few seconds for him to realize that she was looking for a response. He hurriedly shook his head, and she continued, \"Okay, then, you want to be better. If so, I'm about to tell you a truth you won't like.\"Suzy drew him a bit further from her face and said, with nothing but bare naked honesty on her face, \"I felt you down there. You shouldn't have bothered with the clit because you didn't have the leverage. You should have just gone straight inside. Do you know where the G-spot is?\"Aaron tried to keep his expression flat, but he was worried that his surprise showed through anyway. He kept silent, hoping that this was one of the massive woman's monologues again, but, unfortunately, it wasn't. A long, awkwardly long period of silence passed before she asked, \"Well? Do you?\"After another long, painful period of deliberation, he finally shook his head. \"No,\" he admitted, not even sure she could hear his tiny voice.\"Okay then,\" she said, nodding. To his surprise, there was nothing on her expression but acceptance, as if he had told a mechanic that he had a flat tire. \"We can fix that.\"\n","Aaron watched Dominique leave the room, enjoying the sight of her hips shifting back and forth as she walked away, but wondering what on earth was going on. Suddenly, a massive foot slammed down beside him, followed by another one on the other side.

To his surprise, there was nothing on her expression but acceptance, as if he had told a mechanic that he had a flat tire. \"We can fix that.\"Despite the Drill Instructor routine she did as part of her act, Suzy felt no malice against the shrunken man. To be honest, she kind of felt sorry for him. He was just another toy who didn't understand the privilege of his new station, and she felt duty-bound to show him the exciting new life that awaited him. His instinctive aversion to the messy realities of his mistress' body could not be completely eliminated, but they could be overcome by latching a sense of duty onto his job.And that was why she transitioned so quickly to the role of teacher. She was the savior of the hopeless, a woman who redeemed lost causes. And, come hell or high water, she would teach this tiny man how to do his new job, how to do it well, and how to enjoy his new life doing it.And, to do that, she needed the help of her mistress. Back in the day, coordinating it would have been a sloppy process, as they figured out on the fly how much giantess intervention was necessary. After years of practice, though, they had determined exactly where Suzy could be most effective both with and without Dominique's assistance. And, soon, based on a program that had been proven time and time again, Suzy would drag her new student into Dominique's tutelage.Aaron was a sex toy, and he would be one for the rest of his life. Maybe, when Suzy had assumed responsiblity of him, he didn't understand that. Maybe he still entertained fantasies of escaping and living a normal human life. But he had had plenty of opportunities to learn and internalize the fact that his state as an invincible, living toy was irreversible. Her first task had always been establishing that reality without explicitly saying it. After all, telling someone that they were a slave inevitably fomented rebellion, while showing them that they were one encouraged obedience.After her quick, relatively high-intensity introduction for the shrunken man, the time had come to bring her mistress back into the picture. Not just as a speaker or a size prop as she had been before; Suzy could accomplish those jobs herself; but as a participant. A passive, dismissive one, behaving the way that a woman should towards her sex toy.She made a quick sign towards Dominique, watching from out of sight, to tell her that she was done with the first step. In response, Suzy shrank rapidly down to the man's own size, an abrupt and shocking shift in perspective that was still extremely disorienting to her. It took the man by surprise, too, and he scrambled back a bit, fear written on his face despite the fact that her size had become much less imposing to him.Well, clearly she carried authority with him regardless of her size. She slowly sauntered forwards, their gazes locked, and he shrank back as she did. By the time she was straddling him, he was almost flat on his back, eyes wide. \"Who was the last woman you had sex with?\" she asked.He seemed confused, even though it was a straightforward enough question. He saw him glance down slightly, and she rolled her eyes, \"Not me, you idiot.\" She shook her head dismissively and extended her hand for him to grab. \"Stand up,\" she ordered.Aaron grabbed her hand obediently and hauled himself to his feet. She held on to his hand and pressed up close to them, guiding his hand between her legs. She wrapped her other arm around her back, and felt him cringe a bit. There was nothing between their bodies but heat, and, though her body language was that of a lover, his was still all fear and uncertainty.Carefully, she placed the palm of his hand on her crotch, then put her hand on the back of his, their fingers overlapping. Then she pushed his middle two fingers into her pussy with hers, letting out a breath of pleasure into his ear.\"Squeeze,\" she purred. And he offered a halfhearted tickle in response. \"Harder.\"He got it, a bit at least. It felt good, but, without more stimulation, it was just pressure. \"Feel that?\" she whispered, \"Like the brake on a bike, rub it, pull on it. As hard as you can.\"He finally did it, and kept doing it, and her knees weakened at the sudden wave of pleasure. She almost melted into him, wondering what harm it would do to let him finish before they continued. \"Keep going,\" she moaned, \"Just like that.\"She caught Dominique out of the corner of her eye, silently approaching the table, and slapped his hand away, stepping back. He immediately retreated like a rebuked puppy, but Suzy didn't push him, focusing instead on ignoring the warmth and the wet between her legs. It took her a second to compose herself, but, when she did, there was no trace left of her lust in her voice. \"Now let's see if you can do it from inside a woman.\"With perfect timing, Dominique's hand slammed into her from the back barely a second after she finished speaking, wrapping around the pair of them and pressing them into a unwilling lovers' embrace. Suzy's stomach dropped as she rose into the sky, and, unable to see anything but the dark flesh of her mistress' palm, and with heat surrounding her from head to toe, the movement was panic-inducing.Then, in an equally-disorienting move, they were flipped upside-down. Suzy knew what was happening long before the shrunken man did, based on his shocked face at the sudden motion. So she was not at all surprised when the cold air around her feet was replaced with the sensation of warm, soft, wet flesh. Aaron was, though. She felt his entire body twitch in surprise at the sudden transition. With that kind of reaction, she thought, he was not going to enjoy what happened next.She only had a split-second view of what would happen next. Dominique opened her hand just barely enough for her to see the dark brown flesh of her crotch, a tiny sliver of pink vulnerability showing through the wrinkled labia. Aaron, too busy worrying about his immediate surroundings, had no idea what was about to happen to him, and Suzy had no intention to warn him.In an instant, both of them were shoved from head to toe into Dominique's vagina. Suzy welcomed the sudden warmth and pressure, the feeling of the soft flesh against every curve of her body, but the shrunken man beside her clearly did not share her perspective. He started to struggle like a man cast into the ocean. He writhed violently back and forth, twisting and squirming with everything he could muster. It wasn't much; the giantess' vaginal walls were like a latex glove, restricting all movement; but it was enough to be distracting to any woman.Most of all Suzy. This panicked amateur was pressed up right against her face. She got tired of that kind of behavior rather quickly. \"Hey!\" she barked. Her voice didn't carry at all when surrounded by flesh, but, fortunately, Aaron was so close as to be hugging her. She was shouting directly into his ear, so he heard everything quite clearly. \"Calm down!\"It took a few seconds, but he did eventually settle down. She tried to adjust herself, to get a more professional position against the shrunken man, but the walls of Dominique's vagina held them together too tight. Aaron could have had sex with her without moving, but, fortunately, that didn't occur to him just yet. She was pressed up against him well enough that she knew that he was still soft. If she let things rest, though, he might get adventurous, and, even though she lived her life as a sex toy, she didn't enjoy the prospect of being raped while inside another woman. So she had to get things moving, and fast.\"This is your chance to prove yourself,\" she said. Now that he had calmed down, she could speak normally. Despite the pounding of Dominique's heartbeat that surrounded them on all sides, the two of them were pushed so closely together that neither of them could speak but directly into each others' ear. The steady thump-thump of the giantess' pulse was deafening, and the flesh around them muted every other sound, but Aaron could still hear her speak.She grabbed the man's head and forced him to look in her eyes, \"You know where her G-spot is now, right?\" His wide-eyed, fearful expression took a moment to resolve itself into a semblance of reason. When he finally managed to compose himself, he nodded frantically.\"Good,\" Suzy said, assuming a sultry smile. \"Then show her.\"Pressed against him as she was, she didn't really have full visiblity on what he was doing. She could see that his arms and legs were both moving, carefully exploring the inside of her mistress' vagina around Suzy's slender figure, but she couldn't really tell if he was accomplishing anything. Frankly, she wasn't even sure if he was doing it on the right side; Dominique had shoved them inside her pussy too fast for her to figure out how they were oriented.But the giantess' body proved the success of his effort. After only about a minute of his delibierate massaging of the inside of Dominique's vagina, her pelvic muscles clenched hard, driving the air out of Suzy's lungs as she was pushed even harder against Aaron's body. For the brief moment of that punishing contraction, she could feel that even Aaron had to stop moving.But when it finally let up, when she was able to pull herself back far enough to actually see Aaron's face, she saw the greedy, horny expression there. Only then did she realize that he had grown hard in that short moment of the giantess' contraction, and there was no escaping his next move.Aaron was positioned perfectly. His hands slid down her back, cupped her ass, and guided her hips directly onto his dick. She felt it enter her, and, despite herself, let out a moan at the sudden sensation of that warm body filling her. Then Aaron started to thrust, using his arms and legs against the flexible walls of the giantess' pussy as leverage. Dominique's pelvic muscles closed hard around them again, and Suzy realized that the tiny man was somehow both having sex with her and stimulating her mistress' G-spot. What the fuck was he doing? How could he be this good when he had seemed so unwilling just half an hour ago? Then he drove his dick deep into her, and she lost track of that line of thought, a pleasured moan escaping her lips, immediately lost to the flesh that surrounded her. Fuck it. Just let him do his thing.Suzy wrapped her arms and legs around the shrunken man, leaving him to use the leverage of the giantess' vaginal walls to fuck her good and hard. She could feel his arms and legs moving behind her, and, after only a few short seconds, felt the muscles that surrounded her body squeeze hard.The giantess' contraction barely slowed him down, and Suzy really didn't care to try and stop him either. Eyes closed, she savored the feeling of his cock thrusting into her, again, and again, and again, and again, and again. Minutes passed, and so did Dominique's vaginal contractions. Clearly, Aaron was doing an impressive job pleasing her, and he wasn't doing too poorly with Suzy, either. Just a few more minutes...Then he came. She felt the hot shot of fluid inside her clear as day, and his entire body shuddered against hers as he blew his load. She rolled her eyes. She had been so close, but he had dropped the ball, and she knew her mistress well enough to know that he hadn't managed to finish her off either.Rare was the man who could disappoint two women at once. She had really hoped that this guy would be able to pull it off, but there was nothing really lost by his failure. If Suzy had control over the guy's size, she'd shrink him down and use him as a dildo in the midst of his own sperm; finish herself off after the disappointing ending he had given her. But she didn't, so she could only carry on with the training script. \"You almost had it,\" she said playfully, pecking him on the lips, \"We'll make a toy out of you yet.\"\n","Aaron was in a living hell. A punishment, he was sure, but he couldn't tell what he had done to deserve it. He couldn't tell what he was supposed to learn from it, and he had no idea when it was going to end. All he could do was endure it, and pray that it would end soon.Suzy was fully-sized, fully-clothed, and had shrunk him down to barely four inches. He was buried in her asshole up to his neck, left to struggle desperately against the ordeal of the giantess' life. With every step she took, the enormous muscles that surrounded him shifted painfully up and down, grinding painfully across his head. Sweat poured from the flesh that surrounded him, filling his world with a sour stench and a salty taste.No matter how hard he fought, he had no chance of earning reprieve from this torture. The giantess' careless gait tossed him back and forth, and her muscles beat at him from one side, then the other, with every step that she took. It was hot, painful, and the only air to breathe was the nauseating miasma of stench that most people kept trapped within the waistband of their underwear.How long had it been? Hours? Days? Long enough that he had settled from shock and disbelief at his hostile, miserable existence to a calm, if uncomfortable acceptance of his conditions. It was part of a broader lesson he had learned in what was undoubtedly weeks spent under the giantess' 'instruction.' He was at the point, now, where he was at least familiar with what he could expect when Suzy decided where she wanted to 'store' him. Be it her pocket, her shoe, her underwear, or whatever other weird accessory or body part she found most entertaining at the time, he knew what was going to happen. There was no more shock to it, there was just discomfort that had to be endured until it was over.He had to admit that Suzy keeping him in her asshole was a new one. It would have struck him as too uncomfortable, especially for a long period of time. But here he was, helpless against the flexing muscles that squeezed around his head from both sides. He was fully aware of how pathetic it was that even bothered to think about how his unfortunate position was how unpleasant it might be for the woman who had put him there.Finally, light came flooding in from the outside world. His eyes blinded, Aaron gulped down the first breaths of fresh air that he had enjoyed in what felt like forever. But he barely had a moment to process the sudden change before he felt Suzy's fingers on his head, pinching down so hard as to squash his skull. He let out a yelp, but the giantess was unrelenting. She pulled, pulled, and pulled, yanking him with careless force completely out of her asshole.She didn't savor, and she didn't linger. In barely seconds, Aaron's entire body was squeezed painfully out of the giantess' asshole and out into the outside world, the open air chilling against skin coated in slimy bodily fluids.Before he could get his bearings, he was flying through the air, tossed aside carelessly by the giantess whose weight he had suffered under for the last eternity. A muted television, a cheap desk chair, a fluorescent overhead light, and he hit the surface of a bed so hard that it drove the wind from his lungs.A hotel room. He could figure that much from what he had seen, but he had to focus on catching his breath for now. He stared up at the dull white ceiling, gasping like a fish out of water, trying to recover from the shocking transition. Fuck. Was it going to be like this every time? He wasn't sure he could get used to this.He heard the door open, and managed to twist his head around to see it. A hotel room, definitely. The door had the chain bolt and keycard reader to prove it. Dominique stepped in, dressed in tight jeans and a loose T-shirt, seeming not even to notice Aaron's tiny body. Suzy was just a step away, hiking her pants back up to her waist after removing Aaron from his miserable prison.Dominique was the first to speak, though she waited for the door to shut before she did so. ''You fly out tonight?''Suzy nodded, doing up the buttons to her pants. ''At nine, or so.''''I'll see you in London, then.''It was too much for Aaron. Where the fuck was he?\"Safe travels, love,'' Suzy said. She stepped up to Dominique and gave her a peck on the lips. In any other context, Dominique's loving smile might have been heartwarming, but not when it was on the face of the woman who had taken on the task of 'training' him to be a sex slave. \"You too,\" she said. Suzy looked back at Aaron, and he felt himself shrink back involuntarily under her hungry gaze. She saw his reaction, and a predatory smile started to creep onto her face. \"When do we get to have fun with him together?\" she asked.\"Soon,\" Dominique promised. She didn't even bother to look Aaron's way. \"Soon enough. Now get out of here before the cab leaves.\"Suzy tore her gaze from Aaron with clear reluctance. \"Love you,\" she said.\"I love you too.\"As Suzy opened the door, Dominique gave her a gentle slap on the ass, prompting a yelp of surprise. Suzy looked back, one foot outside and the other inside, debating whether to give the other giantess another kiss. Then, apparently deciding against it, she slid out the door and let it fall shut behind her.The moment the latch clicked shut, Dominique's gaze snapped towards Aaron.He cringed instinctively under the giantess' gaze. But, despite his visceral panic, her expression was calm, without a single hint of sexual or sadistic intent. It took a minute, but she maintained eye contact with him, seeming to will him to be calm, urging him that there was, for now, nothing to be afraid of.He didn't trust it for a moment, but it had the psychological effect she wanted. He didn't run, he didn't hide, and he didn't even think for a moment that this was his first and best real opportunity to try either of those things in his whole time shrunken.After a moment, Dominique broke eye contact, then shed the bag she had on her shoulders, unzipped it, and pulled out a six-pack of beer. \"Want a drink?\"If she had timed it right, Dominique had less than five minutes before the shrunken man would be raised to full size. Three hundred seconds, every one of which was crucial, because, under any other circumstance, an unwilling shrinkee would take the opportunity to fight or to flee. Aaron, as far as she could tell, was a pretty sturdy dude; he could overpower her easily, and, according to the schedule, he wouldn't be shrunken back down until tomorrow morning. She had to tread very carefully.That's why she had opened with the beer. She crossed the room with a lazy pace, fully aware that she was on a timer, but dedicated to keeping up appearances. She pulled two bottles out of the pack before throwing the rest into the mini-fridge under the television. She didn't have a bottle opener, so she took one bottle and put the cap against the edge of the television stand, and smacked it with her palm, popping the first bottle open with a tiny spray of beer.\"In five minutes, you're about to grow to full size,\" she said, looking at the tiny man stranded in the middle of the mattress. \"You can run, you can fight, or you can listen to what I have to say.\" She took a sip of her beer. \"But here's the thing. The only reason I want you at full size for this is so you understand I'm telling the truth, you understand?\"She eyed the tiny man for long enough that, eventually, he caught on that he should nod in response. Fuck, mate. The clock is ticking.\"We could fight. You'll probably win,\" Dominique said. \"Or you could crack a beer with me and we could have an honest conversation about what's going on here.\" The tiny man seemed skeptical, so Dominique took the second bottle and opened it like she had the first, placing it on the nightstand next to the bed the tiny man lay on. \"Trust me,\" she said, \"You'll want to hear what I have to say.\"Aaron's tiny face still betrayed his every thought, and he was clearly torn between curiosity and suspicion. With her time as the dominant party quickly diminishing, Dominique could not afford the latter, so she dug into her bag and produced her badge, flipping it open for him to see. \"Dominique Tipper, Interpol,\" she said, with the most serious tone she could manage. \"You're my best contact right now, so please... Listen to what I have to say.\"That appeared to mollify him, and just in time. She checked her watch. Less than thirty seconds left. Moving as calmly as she could, she put her own beer down and grabbed the one she had just opened off the nightstand. In that moment, Aaron's tiny figure exploded into full size.The transition was clearly shocking for him, but, as he regained his bearings, she offered the beer. \"Here,\" she said, \"Have a drink.\"Aaron was a bigger man than she expected. He had more than six inches on her, and, with his broad shoulders and thickly muscled frame, could very well weigh twice as much as she did. But, despite the clear shift in the power dynamic between the two of them, he still held himself like he was the shrunken, submissive party. Refusing to make eye contact, he took the beer, then brought it towards his lap without taking a sip.Dominique grabbed her own beer and extended the bottle as a toast. \"Come on,\" she said. \"Enjoy it.\"Aaron lifted his gaze to meet hers. He was a broken man, she could see as much in his expression, but he raised his bottle and clinked it against hers. She took a drink when he did, and he followed her example. He was still naked. Maybe clothing could help. She went to the closet and pulled out a bathrobe. \"Here,\" she said, tossing the thin garment at him. \"Get comfortable. We have all night.\"Aaron, moving uncertainly, put the bathrobe on, then sat back down on the bed to take another swill of beer. He was still acting like an abused puppy, but Dominique supposed that, given what he had undergone under Suzy's instruction, she couldn't expect anything else. Honestly, it made her feel a bit better about how this interaction could work out for her; she had entered it with the fullest expectation that the tiny man could try to kill her in a desperate bid to escape his life as a sex toy.Dominique was trying to figure out when it would be appropriate to give her pitch, then Aaron let out a deep, exhausted sigh. He looked up at her, his expression desperate, and he asked, \"What's happening?\"Dominique nodded slowly. That was all she needed. \"You've been kidnapped by a international sex trafficking organization. They sold you to Emma, and she brought you to me.\"\"Can't you help me?\" Aaron asked.The desperation in his voice was heartbreaking. She wanted nothing more than to be able to say 'yes,' but she couldn't. \"I can't, at least not for now,\" she said. His shoulders sagged, and his gaze drifted downwards. She had never seen such a dejected expression all her years doing this, though she had never had a contact so close to the problem. \"Look,\" she said. Aaron kept his gaze down, barely twitching in response to her voice. \"Hey, look!\" His eyes came up, meeting hers, \"We're trying to figure all this shit out. You're not the only one. In fact, you're lucky that I found you. If you help me, we can blow this thing open.\"That seemed to get his attention. His expression perked up, and he took a sip of his beer. \"How?\" he asked.\"We've been trying to pin this organization down for almost two years,\" Dominique said. \"We don't really understand how they're shrinking people, we don't really know what the shrinking even does. They're kidnapping people to shrink, but we don't know how or why, and the people they kidnap have their memories wiped, so they can't help.\"\"So...\"\"So you're our best chance to answer those questions,\" Dominique said, \"Through Emma, we can start to draw the full picture. But we can't move until we have all the facts, otherwise this Program will disappear, and we're back at square one.\"Aaron downed the rest of his beer in a single gulp. \"Then what do you want from me?\"\"Play along,\" Dominique said. \"Be the thing Emma wants you to be.\"Aaron's gaze dropped again. That was a brutal thing for him to accept, she knew, but his sense of helplessness could be as dangerous, in the long run, as a refusal to cooperate entirely. He had to realize that he was doing this for the greater good. Fuck, Dominique had put her life on the line merely by trying to recruit him. Her adversary was vast, mysterious, and powerful; if they caught wind of her efforts, she might disappear without a trace, maybe sold off as a shrunken sex toy to whoever could afford it.\"Look, she didn't wipe your memory. For some reason, she doesn't want to,\" Dominique told him. She grabbed another beer from the pack, opened it, and handed it to him in exchange for his empty glass. \"That puts you in a unique position. I convince her that you need to come back to me periodically, and you can tell me what you've learned from being with her.\"\"I've learned nothing!\" Aaron exclaimed, surging forward with surprising violence. \"She's tortured me! This other girl... Suzy, that bitch... She's tortured me too! And you did nothing, and now you want me to...\" He fell back, running his hand through his hair. \"Fuck. When does this end?\"Dominique felt for him, she really did, but her empathy was tainted by her fear. Did he know how much power he had over her merely by how she had exposed herself to him? Would it be worse if he didn't know? He could say three words, 'Dominique is Interpol,' and she'd disappear forever, probably as a shrunken sex slave for a particularly sadistic customer. \"I can't say for sure,\" she said. \"The more information you can pass me, the sooner I can help you.\"\"Okay...\"\"That means that you have to seem as willing as possible. Earn her trust. Meet her friends and family. Report as much back to me as you can.\" Dominique paused. Maybe diplomacy should take a back seat to honesty here. \"It might be easier than you think. Do you know what she wants from you?\"Aaron shook his head and shrugged. \"To make my life a living hell,\" he said bitterly.\"She wants a loyal slave. She doesn't want to have to shrink you down and shove you up her cooter for the rest of her life, she wants someone she can trust to be loyal to her, no matter what size. If I send you back to her, and you show that you're that person, then you might spend more of you're time at full size than not.\"\"Like that... Suzy?\" Aaron asked. Dominique nodded. \"Is she in on it too?\" he asked.\"No,\" answered Dominique. \"She's one of the few people who volunteered to be shrunk, so she's totally willing. It's complicated, and some of the things she does are... unpleasant... but it really helps to have her here.\"\"Unpleasant?\" Aaron demanded. \"You saw what she did to me! You watched! Fuck, you helped!\"Dominique nodded somberly, trying to keep calm in the face of his rising anger. \"And you're not the only one. It breaks my heart to support this kind of evil shit, but every shrunken person is another thread back to a client of the Program, which helps us uncover who they are and where they operate.\" She tossed back the rest of her beer and slammed the bottle down. \"Once we put all the pieces together, we're going to go full Nuremberg on these motherfuckers.\"She sat down on the bed next to Aaron. \"Look,\" she said, \"I'm asking a lot of you. All that disgusting, degrading shit you've had to experience so far, it's probably going to keep happening, and I don't know for how long. But you're my best chance so far to blow it open. Can you help me?\"Aaron swung his beer bottle between his fingers, watching the fluid slosh around inside the brown glass. He was silent for a long moment, and Dominique was silent too, letting him think about his answer for as long as he had to.\"I think...\" He paused, then nodded, \"I think I can. Can you help me?\"\"In time,\" Dominique promised. \"If this goes well, Emma will be the first to go down, and you'll be the first to be freed.\"\"Why me?\" he asked.Dominique sighed. \"I don't know. Bad luck, I guess. But Emma chose not to wipe your memory when she had the chance. For some reason, she wants you to remember everything, so that makes you my best chance to uncover that fucked-up Program that brought you here in the first place.\"\"Okay...\"\"Look, here's the plan. When you get back to Emma, you're going to be the perfectly loyal slave she wants you to be. She'll probably dump her boyfriend, then she'll start going around in public with you at her side. At home, in the bedroom, she'll probably abuse you like she has already, but, if you pretend like you're willing, you'll get to live the closest thing to a normal life you can hope for.\" Dominique was talking out her ass, and she knew it. This was pure supposition based on what she had experienced with the other clients she had worked with. \"You'll meet all of the weird socialites she associates with, the millionaires, the superstars, the power brokers. Any time any one of them even implies a role in the Program, you commit everything to memory and bring it back to me, okay?\"Aaron nodded. \"Is that what they call it? The 'Program?'\"\"As far as we can tell, yes,\" Dominique answered. \"Do you think you can do this?\"Aaron took a deep breath, and let it out with a shake of his head. Dominique waited patiently as he stared into the middle distance, beer in hand, contempleting what he was buying himself into. After a minute, he took another drink, and looked up at her. \"I'm in,\" he said.Dominique nodded somberly. \"Good.\" She stood up and went to pick up her bag from the floor. \"Now, let's find out who the hell you are.\"\"What?\" he asked.\"The Program wipes the memories of everyone it kidnaps. We don't know how, yet, but your DNA is still the same,\" said Dominique. She pulled a fingerprint kit out of her bag and a cotton swab. \"This is our best chance to return you to the life you had before. You okay with that?\"Aaron nodded, and extended his hand. Dominique inked his fingertips and led him through the process of committing his fingerprints to paper. Then she ran the cotton swab against the inside of his cheek and deposited it in a plastic bag. What she couldn't tell him was that there was no way she could make a search for this biometric data until the risk provided by the Program had been eliminated. \"You'll remain full-sized until tomorrow morning,\" she said. \"I couldn't afford to leave you like that any longer, to keep up appearances. We're flying back to London tomorrow, and I'll return you to Emma. It'll be boring, but it'll at least be comfortable.\"\"Okay...\" said Aaron.\"I'll be in the room next door. Your key is on the desk. Just knock if you need me,\" Dominique said. She made her way to the door of the hotel room, and paused on her way out to turn back. \"I'm counting on you,\" she said. \"If you pull this off, we'll put these cunts away forever.\"\n","Emma wore a broad grin as she made her merry way back to Dom's house. The training period was over, and she had been told, in a cryptic text message that was apropos of the Program, that it had been a resounding success. Her tiny man, Aaron, was a totally willing slave. In fact, as Dominique said it, he actually wanted to see her. She could barely hide her excitement.A small corner of her brain wondered how she would go about dumping her boyfriend. She certainly didn't need him anymore, not with a loyal slave who could live at any size. In hopeful expectation of this moment, she had already started to distance herself from him, but he still had a key to her flat. She'd have to take care of that, and without attracting too much attention from the press. Maybe she could do it late on a Saturday evening. That would help.She knocked on Dominique's door, and the woman answered almost immediately, looking for all the world like she had just rolled out of bed. A baggy T-shirt, extremely generous gym shorts, and hair that formed a wild, unkempt halo around her head. Even so, the girl's sloppy appearance had a certain charm. \"Emma, love! Welcome back!\" she exclaimed. She opened the door a bit wider and invited Emma to come in.\"Happy to see you, Dom.\"\"It's my pleasure, for sure,\" replied Dominique. \"So your little Aaron is exactly where you wanted him to be.\"\"Really?\"\"Oh, it took a while. Might've been easier if you let me wipe him,\" Dominique said with a wink, \"But I think you'll like what you see. He's in the other room, come on.\"Emma followed, letting the door slam shut behind her. She couldn't help but notice Suzy sitting at the table in the living room, wearing more clothes than Dominique did, and reading the fucking newspaper. Really? She had so many questions about that, but kept them to herself.But, as she turned the corner, she saw the man... Aaron... standing upright, full-sized, his hands crossed behind his back, seemingly waiting for orders like a soldier in formation. His skin was ghostly pale; understandable, given what he had experienced for the last month or so; but he had a really, really impressive figure, lean and covered in wiry muscle, with barely a single hint of fat to soften the edges. But Emma's eyes couldn't help but gravitate down below his waist, where an impressive dick swung surprisingly far down. Emma gaped. She had complete control over this man. She already knew that she could enter his mind and control his body, but had largely refrained from doing so during the training after trying once and having to endure even a few moments of the incredible, suffocating pressure of being under some giantess' foot. But what was the point of doing so now? If Dom was right, he'd obey her every word, so no explicit control was needed.But she wasn't really comfortable with a sexual display of her control, not right now, not with Dominique watching and Suzy just in the other room. Instead, she straightened up, looked the man in the eyes, and said, \"You, Aaron. Who do you belong to?\"\"I belong to you, mistress,\" the man said without hesitation, bowing his head.Emma glanced briefly at Dominique. She had a look of pride that made her look like a master artist displaying her greatest work. Emma couldn't deny that she deserved to feel that way, but she had no way to read any further into the man's behavior; did he really believe himself to be her property, or was he hiding something?Obviously, she couldn't demand any demeaning sexual shit out of him right now, but she could test her control over him in some way. \"Lie down,\" she ordered sternly.He didn't respond verbally, but he dropped to the floor immediately, eyes down, arms and legs all tense and ready for the next order. He looked like he was ready to start doing pushups. Emma admired his impressive frame for a moment, then said, \"Stand up.\"He lept to his feet with stunning speed and stood there, his eyes focused on the middle distance, waiting patiently for his next task. \"Now, do star-jumps until I tell you not to.\"He hesitated, confusion clearly written on his face despite his effort not to show it. Dominique huffed in amusement. \"She means jumping jacks,\" she said.He complied immediately, jumping up and down with vigor. Dom's flat was suddenly filled with the pounding of his weight on the floor and the heavy sound of his deep, measured breathing. With every jump, his chest muscles bounced up and down, and his dick flopped amusingly in every direction. Emma watched, transfixed, at the spectacle of his body for a minute, before Dominique cleared her throat and snapped her out of her trance. \"He's not a used car, love. You don't need to try him out. Just take him home and have fun.\"\"I was just trying to see...\"\"I'm sure you'll put him through much harder activity than this nonsense,\" Dominique told her, tossing her head at the naked man. \"But he'll obey you, I promise.\"Emma looked at her, then down at her feet. \"Right... I just...\"\"Still...\" Dominique was eyeing Aaron with a very transparent, very hungry look. \"You definitely picked a good one, though,\" she said, biting her lip.\"Stop,\" ordered Emma. The man stopped immediately, straightening back into the position he had assumed when she entered the room. She looked at Dominique, whose eyes were fixed unsubtly on Aaron's considerable genitalia. \"We're going home. You ready?\"\"Yes, mistress,\" he replied, without hesitation.Emma shrank him down as fast as she could. Four inches, that should be enough. No fancy gestures or magic words necessary; she just had to want him to be that size; and, in seconds, he was. He may have tried to hide it, but there was no disguising the sudden fear in his rapidly-diminishing facial expressions. Shrinking down, especially without warning, must be one hell of an experience. She'd have to try it from his perspective someday.When he was small enough to fit in her hand, she plucked him off the ground, barely looking at him as she opened up her puse with her other hand and dropped him in. He didn't need an explanation, and he shouldn't expect one. He was hers now, and, fuck, that felt good.She zipped her purse closed and set it down. \"Thanks again, Dom,\" she said.\"It's my pleasure, love,\" Dominique replied, with the broad, luminous smile that Emma knew so well. \"He's not a finished product yet, right? You have to bring him back every now and again, okay?\"That was new. \"Why?\" Emma asked.\"Right now, he trusts you because I told him to,\" answered Dominique. \"If you break off his relationship with me too fast, it might hurt his relationship with you.\"\"Alright,\" Emma said with a shrug. \"It makes sense. How often?\"\"Once a week for a little while, and less often going forwards. I'll send you the dates and times.\"Emma smiled. Dom was really just the best. \"Thanks again, truly,\" she said, crossing her hands over her breast.Dominique crossed her arms and turned away, making a show of being dismissive even as her face betrayed her own gratitude. \"Oh, don't even mention it, love,\" she said. \"You have fun, then.\"Every minute, every mile, was pure fucking torture. Emma was so horny that she could feel her own heartbeat in her pussy, pounding so loud that she was sure everyone on the tube could hear it. The shrunken man, buried somewhere the purse she kept tucked tightly under her arm, seemed to have a physical presence that she could feel. He wasn't just a sex toy. He was a willing, living, breathing, loving sex slave. Her every whim obeyed at every time, at every size, with a willing eagerness. She had never before wanted something so badly.Someone on the public transit recongized her, and demanded a selfie. In a libido-fueled trance, she obliged, and gripped the man's ass just as the picture was taken without even knowing what she was doing. His stunned look as the flash went off made for a priceless, and useless photo. He scuttered away, speechless, and she stepped off the tube at the next stop, not even acknowledging what she had done.The next quarter-hour passed in a haze of imagined sexual fantasies. There were so many things she could do with this man; she couldn't wait to do them all, even though she knew that her body would eventually stop her from carrying on further. Even so, the knowledge that the endurance of her new sex toy was completely irrelevant was that much more exciting.She burst into her apartment, pausing only briefly to verify that her boyfriend wasn't around, then fished desperately into her purse to procure the little man. Her fingers wrapped around his tiny body, and she tossed him out into the hallway just as she started to grow him to full size. The look of shock on his rapidly-growing face was clearly evident as she kicked off her shoes, stripped her shirt, and started to shimmy her pants off of her waist.\nNaked but for her bra and panties, she slammed the deadbolt shut and leaned up against the door, breathing heavy and looking at the newly-resized, stark naked man. \"I want you to fuck me,\" she ordered.\n","The sudden transition was violent and disorienting. The world shrank... or his body grew, as he soared through the air, and hit the ground with a dizzyingly hard impact. It took a moment for him to regain his bearings. A narrow, carpeted hallway, fluorescent lights shining down on him from above, off-white walls on either side and, at the far end, Emma Watson. Her shoes and clothes were in a bundle beside her, and she wore nothing but her underwear, her back against the door and breathing heavy.\"I want you to fuck me,\" she gasped.Aaron took several long seconds to process what the fuck was happening. He had already kind of accepted the reality that he would have to do whatever Emma asked him to, but that long, chaotic period spent tumbling around in the bottom of her purse seemed to prevent him from adequately processing what she wanted of him. \"Come on,\" Emma insisted, taking slow steps forwards. Her arms folded behind her back, and, after a moment, her bra fell loose. Her slight breasts sagged just barely when released, revealing her small, dark-brown nipples. She spread her arms invitingly, baring every curve of her slender, almost-naked body.Notwithstanding Aaron's disorientation, the sight sent a rush of blood between his legs. He had to obey, right? Well, she had just given him the easiest order in the world to follow. His right hand snapped forward, he grabbed her by the neck and swung her to the side, slamming her into the wall. With his hand wrapped around her throat, there was, for a brief second, a look of fear in her eyes. In that moment, Aaron had the sudden thought that he could end it. This life as her slave, the undercover agent bullshit. All he had to do was squeeze and twist...But the thought only lasted as long as Emma's look of shock. Her expression morphed into one of sultry desire, and Aaron suddenly realized that there was absolutely nothing he could do to her. Whatever he tried to do, she could stop with nothing more than a moment's thought, and his one lifeline, the escape that Dominique had promised him, would be gone forever. He took a deep breath through his nose, trying to subdue his suddenly violent impulse. He lowered his head and brushed his lips against Emma's tits. She exhaled lustily through her nose, and he took in a lungful of Emma's warm, heady scent, rich with pheromones; his murderous desire all but evaporated. He still felt some resentment towards this woman, his captor, his torturer, but it seemed, in that moment, that he had a new way to assert himself to her.Aaron slid his hand between Emma's legs, his fingers probing effortlessly underneath her panties and into the wet flesh beneath. She let out a quiet moan, pressing her body against his. Aaron responded by shoving his middle two fingers forcefully inside her. Her open-mouthed gasp was something to be savored, but he wasn't anywhere near done.Her left leg wrapped around his back, and he let loose his grip on her throat to take the crook of her knee in his hand. His fingers probed her soft, wet insides, and she was totally into it. Her hips rocked, her eyes closed, and her mouth gaped. The face of pure ecstasy.Only his middle two fingers were inside her, and they were only halfway in. How was it possible that her vagina, which he had totally under his control now, could have been such a source of unending torture for so long? But this was no time to regret his limited reality. Holding the crotch of her panties to the side, he slowly pulled her hips down until his cock slid directly into her. In that moment, her face was one of unfiltered pleasure. Her eyes closed, her head tilted back, and her mouth gaped. Again, it occurred to him that he could put an end to this, he could kill her, but he realized, after a pause, that it would still be too difficult. The chance too remote, the consequences of failure too high. For now, Dominique was still his best way out of this.He placed his left hand on the small of her back, and started to drive in and out of her, as hard as he could, as deep as he could, savoring the bounce of her little tits and her pleasured gasp that followed every thrust. Her left leg wrapped tighter around her, and he suddenly found himself lifting more and more of her weight, until he had to shift his hands under her ass. When he did, her other leg lifted off the ground and wrapped around his back as well. She was light, but, even pinned against the wall, he couldn't get that much leverage against her.Through his unfortunate experience, he already knew where her bedroom was. With his dick buried all the way inside her, he pulled her off the wall and stepped slowly down the hall. Her arms wrapped tight around his back, her head rested on his shoulders, and her hips slid up and down, grinding her pussy across his groin. With every step, she bounced up and down a little, and she was clearly loving it. When he finally made it into the room, he bent his legs a little, and thrusted Emma off of him onto the bed. She hit the mattress with a gasp, then a giggle. As Aaron loomed over her, she raised her legs straight up and started to slide her panties off, looking at him from behind her thighs with her head tilted. \"You like doing that, don't you?\"\"I like it rough,\" Aaron replied. He stepped up to her and pulled her panties off all the way, tossing them to the side and leaving her wearing nothing but her socks. Her legs spread willingly for him and wrapped around his back like the legs of a spider, pulling him towards her. He obliged, grabbing her hips and slowly sliding his cock inside her.That look on her face, the desperate breath she took, the form of her body when he entered her, that feeling of warmth and power with her body totally submitted to his, it was almost worth the miserable existence he had endured as her sex toy.Almost. He'd do anything to get out of it, anything that Dominique asked of him, but there was still no denying that this was a silver lining. \"Emma?\"That voice was new. Emma's face went from pleasure to shock, staring at something behind him. Aaron twisted around, still inside her, and saw another man standing in the doorway.Redheaded, square-jawed, garbed in casual, all-black wear, fit but with a tiny beer gut just barely visible beneath his loose-fitting shirt. Aaron had never seen this man before in his life, but a sinking feeling in his chest told him that he had probably been pinned underneath his cock before, as a millimeter-tall unwilling passenger between two giants having sex.Her boyfriend, no doubt. With keys to the apartment and who could enter without announcing himself. Who clearly appeared shocked and hurt at the sight of another man literally inside his girlfriend. For a moment, all three of them were in shock. Nobody said anything to anyone. In that instant, Aaron could feel his erection softening, and realized suddenly how absolutely absurd it was to focus on that, of all things.Wait. Was this his chance to escape?\"Fucking cunt,\" the stranger said. He had an Irish accent. Before Aaron could even react, the Irishman had turned on his heel and walked out of the room. A second later, Aaron heard the door slam, and the dull thuds of the stranger angrily descending the stairs outside the apartment.Aaron stepped back from Emma's naked body. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I didn't...\"\"Hey!\" Emma snapped. She pushed herself up off the bed with frightening speed to stand right in front of him. She was shorter than him, and totally naked but for a pair of pink socks, but she was still incredibly intimidating. \"Did I tell you to stop?\"Aaron raised his hands defensively. \"I just...\"\"You don't get to make decisions around here,\" she said sternly, jabbing her finger at his chest. As she spoke, she slowly circled around him. Aaron only cast a glance at her tits once, and regretted it immediately. She drew closer; he could feel the heat of her body on his skin; until he was backed up against the bad. \"Forget about that loser,\" she said. \"I told you to fuck me.\"Emma laid her palm on his chest, and shoved. He fell backwards onto the bed, and she followed, climbing onto the mattress on her knees. The whole time, she stared down at him, her expression deadly serious, keeping his eyes locked to hers. With all the unexpected drama, he was at half mast now, but she didn't care. She planted herself on his hips, right above his crotch, and, with one hand on his chest, pinning him against the bedsheets, she reached back with the other and started massaging his groin.Her slender fingers, her tender touch sent a rush of blood below his waist despite the awkward situation. He stared up at her, unbelieving, and she stared down at him, commanding. She didn't even break eye contact; once he was fully erect again, she raised her hips, and guided herself down until he was all the way inside her.In that moment, when he entered her, the expression on her face was quite unlike what it had been before. Her mouth gaped, and her eyes fluttered, but it wasn't a look of pleasure. There was pleasure there, for sure, but it was the pleasure of control. Of total domination. She looked down at the junction of their intimate union, the soft flesh of her crotch pressed forcefully against his pelvis, the subtle bump of his cock inside her, and gave him a wolfish grin.The air reeked of sex, the heat of her seemed to press against his body, but he was totally unsure of what to do next. He reached up to grab her hips, but she swatted his hands away. \"No!\" she ordered. \"Put your hands behind your back.\"Aaron obliged immediately. Emma let her eyes drift shut as she started to gyrate her hips, sliding up and down across his body, his cock still buried inside her. Aaron stared up at her in shock. The woman had been caught cheating not sixty seconds ago, and didn't give a fuck, and now she was riding his dick like nothing had even happened. That was a level of ruthlessness that he couldn't even comprehend.There was a brief moment when her boyfriend was in the room with them that Aaron realized that he could cry for help. Now he was so glad that he didn't make that mistake. Emma had her way with him for the better part of thirty minutes. She had so intimidated him that, despite his erection, he really couldn't bring himself to orgasm. Mounted on top of him, she managed to cum three times, twice by riding him to her satisfaction, and once with his dick outside of her, just sliding the wet slit of her pussy up and down across it. Finally, she fell off of him and onto her back. \"Come on,\" she said breathlessly, spreading her legs, and spreading the lips of her pussy with her left hand. \"Just finish it.\"Orders are orders. He rolled on top of her, slid himself inside her, and started to drill her as fast and as hard as he could manage. With one hand, he kept his body up above the mattress, and, with the other, he gripped her narrow hips for leverage. With his dick driving in and out of her vagina, Emma's eyes rolled back and closed, her face the picture of ecstasy, her entire body shaking with his violent force.Finally in control, it only took about two minutes for him to finish, and he did it while buried balls deep. He groaned, and she let out a breathy squeak, as his cock pulsed and he shot his load inside her. After a moment, or an eternity, of reality-bending pleasure, it was over, and Aaron rolled onto his back.In that brief window of post-orgasm clarity, he knew exactly what was coming next, and he was ashamed that he had let himself fall for it again. But he had to do whatever she ordered, didn't he? That was how Dominique could save him from this hellish life?Emma sighed a deep, satisfied sigh. \"Go do the dishes,\" she said airily.What? He leaned up, looking at her. She didn't even move, but her eyes turned to him, and her expression shifted, speaking without words. Now, it said. Without a word, he lept to his feet. His dick was still wet, slowly deflating under the cold touch of the outside air. He strode out of her bedroom and towards the kitchen, bare feet slapping against hardwood floors.That was... unexpected. So now that she thought she could trust him, it wasn't just all sex, all the time?He could get used to that.\n","Emma leaned up against the wall, naked except for the pair of panties she had slid on to catch the seepage, drinking her tea and watching her bare naked sex toy do the dishes. That ass of his was incredible. She couldn't stop watching it. She took a sip, staring in fascination as his muscles turned and shifted when he put a clean dish on the drying rack and grabbed a new one to scrub.How did he get it looking that good? And how had he kept it that way? As far as she knew, there wasn't a gym in her vagina, so he certainly hadn't been doing any squats while trapped in there. And what about Dominique? Surely she hadn't just been his physical trainer for the last few weeks. Did being shrunken give him some sort of supernatural physical fitness? She couldn't say, but there was no way that the butt she was staring at was totally natural.Emma huffed, and took another sip. A tight body with no effort? Sign me up, please. She was fooling herself, she knew. This moment of satisfied superiority was an illusion. Her boyfriend... ex-boyfriend, now, in all likelihood... had walked in on her with another man inside her. It was going to be a huge mess to clean up; the tabloids had caught more than a few pictures of them together, so they knew what was going on, and they would key into a breakup even if they kept it subtle.Of course, she didn't trust Seamus to keep it subtle for a moment. The cunt would flee to the the first TV show that gave him time to talk about how she had \"betrayed\" him. Just the thought of seeing that interview on the BBC made her grind her teeth, and it got even more complicated from there.She could do some damage control. She could hear her manager's voice in her ear: lie, tell them that the relationship was trouble, that you had told them you were on a break. He was just jealous, he was just trying to take her down, \"these allegations have no merit, and, honestly, I'm shocked...\" Deflect, deny, accuse. But all of that would, ultimately, hinged entirely on her new human sex toy. The tight ass that was cleaning her dishes right now. Emma slurped up more tea... God, that was one juicy booty... Unfortunately, she'd have to drag him in front of the cameras if she was going to tie this whose sordid affair into a narrative that favored her, and that was the absolute last thing she wanted to do.But Dominique said, right? He was loyal, she just had to maintain that loyalty. He was broken in. There was some work to do, but she could trust this guy with her life. He was exactly what she had paid for, all she had dreamed of. Emma chewed on her lip. Ahh, she had fucked up. There was no path out of this that would be better than if she had just left well enough alone. Why the hell had she even reached out to the Program in the first place?Aaron slid the last plate into the drying rack, flicked beads of water off his fingertips into the sink, and turned around. Emma caught her eyes casting downwards... Sure, that ass was fine, but that wasn't the body part that she would write home about... What would it be like for her if she was the tiny one, and he was in charge? She'd get to know that swinging dick intimately, she was sure, but, beyond that...She purged the thoughts, and tossed back the rest of her tea. \"Here,\" she said, extending the empty cup to him, \"You missed one.\"\"Sure.\"Her expression turned hard, and he froze. After a long, quiet moment of indecision, he lifted his head to meet her eyes, with no small amount of fear in his face. She held that stare for a second, then said quietly, \"Yes, mistress.\"\"Yes, mistress,\" he whispered back.She pushed the dirty teacup into his hands and span on her heel, returning to her room to clean up and get dressed. She cast her eyes back for only a second... God, that ass... and slipped into her room. Aaron had been shrunk to barely three inches tall the moment he finished doing the dishes, then snapped up off the ground and deposited on Emma's desk right beside her keyboard. He stood there, not totally sure what the hell Emma wanted from him, as she typed furiously. From where he stood, her fingers were snakes as tall as he was and as thick around as his torso, striking with terrifying precision and a deafening sound over and over again. Her hands and her arms were even worse. They shifted with incredible speed and terrifying randomness; it was a challenge to restrain himself from cringing every time the massive bulk of her body moved.Emma wasn't even paying attention to him; that was the worst part. She wasn't trying to torture him, but, at his size, she could do it without meaning to. He was forced to stand next to the keyboard, to bear witness to the chaotic motion and deafening noise of her typing, and, even though she clearly had no intention of doing anything to him, he had a front-row seat to anything she did try to do.BANGBANG BANGThe noise. The chaos. It was too much. It took a second for Aaron to realize that he was sitting on his ass, driven down by the sheer volume and violence of whatever the hell the giantess had done.\"...went well. We had broken off our relationship weeks ago, and I had hoped that...\" Emma stopped speaking, and looked down at him. He only just barely realized that she had been talking, but she seemed displeased. \"Are you listening?\"Aaron nodded, and the giantess looked back up at her screen and continued. \"I had hoped that he would be discreet about...\" She paused, and frowned. \"No...\"She was silent for a moment, facing her computer screen, but her eyes were scanning, unfocused. She was clearly lost in thought. Aaron dared to raise his voice, \"Excuse me, Mistress?\"The giantess' glazed-over eyes snapped to him instantly, and her expression grew dark. \"Do you care about this?\" she demanded. \"The only reason I'm writing this copy is for you. I could just call my manager...\" She put an imaginary phone to her head and spoke in a singsong voice, tilting her head mockingly as she spoke, \"Hi, my boyfriend caught me cheating on him. Yeah, it's bad. Could you make this not my problem anymore? Thanks, you're the best!\"She made a show of hanging up her phantom phone, then stared at Aaron. \"I've got press,\" she said, with a finality that implied that he was supposed to know what the hell that meant. \"So I either get a solid story, or people start asking questions. Is that what you want?\"Aaron didn't want anything more. If he got lucky, he'd be free of Emma, and Dominique wouldn't be implicated in this grand conspiracy she seemed to be fighting. He couldn't say that, of course, so he just shook his head and stayed quiet. Emma sighed and slumped backwards in her chair, staring at the screen in front of her. After a few seconds of silence, she kicked herself away from the desk and stood up. \"Floor,\" she commanded.Aaron obliged wordlessly, stepping off the edge of the desk and into the void. He was growing as he fell, so rapidly that he didn't really fall so much as his legs just extended to meet the floor. \"You try,\" she said. \"Try to write something that makes him look like the bad guy, but doesn't look like I'm trying to make him look like the bad guy.\"God, she was a cold-hearted bitch. It had barely been an hour since she had been caught cheating, and here she was already trying to ruin the man who had caught her. And she was enlisting Aaron to help. Uncertainly, he sat his naked ass down in the leather chair, the seat still warm, and looked at the short statement she had drafted up in Word; was it supposed to be a press release? An email? A speech? And what the hell did he know about writing that sort of stuff?Whatever it was, it was pretty cold. Distant, indignant, and dishonest. According to this, they had been broken up for weeks. She was in a new relationship now, and she had been trying to keep her private affairs private, and she didn't know why he was suddenly going to the media now with 'these baseless accusations.' It ultimately made it a matter of her word against his, which was probably already a daunting mismatch given her celebrity status, but he would bet that she wasn't going to be satisfied with a 'he-said-she-said' situation. She would want a third party to back her up.Aaron was the only choice for that third party. So whatever words he put into this letter would quickly come back around to bite him in the ass. Was there anything that he could say that would cue anyone, anywhere, into his situation? Any codeword or cipher he could key into the statement that would end this nightmare for him? Time was short, and he was coming up blank. He had nothing. Emma had proven herself more clever at stuff like this at every turn. Any attempt at subverting her effort would only spoil his thin chance at freedom. Instead, he made a show of studying the document, then painstankingly went about changing every 'happy' to 'glad,' even opening up a thesaurus for good measure. He didn't have much to work with, so he worked as slowly as he could, until he heard Emma scoff from behind him.\"Right, so nobody taught you how to write,\" Emma said. \"Right, you're done.\"Abruptly, he started to shrink. He fell into himself as quickly as he had grown, maybe even faster. It only took a few seconds, but he found himself quickly seated awkwardly on the vast sea of leather of the giantess' computer chair. The smell of ass wafted up from the ground beneath him, overwhelming at his size. Aaron had literally been inside Emma's asshole, so it was far from the worst thing he had ever experienced, but it was still repulsive.A shadow cast across him, and he looked up to see Emma's sweatpant-clad butt hanging overhead, ready to slam down on top of him. He let out a shout, but it was too late. The giantess crashed into her seat, and he just barely had the good fortune to survive the impact unharmed, standing intact in the gap between her legs. The force of the giantess' weight striking the chair had knocked him clear off his feet, and he looked up at the massive, living skycraper that towered over him. The baggy, formless sweatshirt she wore obscured her face from this angle, and turned her entire body into a formless mound of loose-fitting cotton. A single strand of auburn hair clung to one of the cloth folds, its split ends dangling only feet above him. He reached up and grabbed it; even at this size, it was weightless and ephemeral, and it dislodged from its resting place and floated down on top of him.The strand of hair was just big enough to kind of tickle. He brushed it off and climbed to his feet. Above him, the giantess was seated upright in her chair, motionless but for her hands; he could hear her typing and he could see her arms moving sublty every which way as she did so. The smell of a thousand farts imbibed into the seat beneath him was completely overwhelmed by the fishy stench of the massive woman's pussy, which washed over him despite the layers of clothes between him and the source. He was too small and too close.Emma leaned back with a sigh and a crashing cacophony of creaking as the back of the chair absorbed her weight. Then, without warning, her left thigh came barreling towards him, knocking him back on his ass, but stopping just before it rolled over him, and her right thigh lifted up, crossing overhead to land on top of her left thigh. The motion was so rapid, so chaotic, so overwhelming in its size and scale that it took a moment for him to realize how inconsequential it had been to her.She had crossed her legs. That's it. She probably didn't even realize she had done it. But now he was trapped in an interesting prison. The seat of her computer chair was his floor and one of her thighs was his wall, while the other was his ceiling, hanging so low overhead that he couldn't do anything but crawl. His only escape was the loose curtain of the cloth of her sweatpants, and he wasn't sure if it was a good idea, but he decided to make his way there regardless. He was safe here, for now, but he would probably be safer somewhere else.His only warning was the creaking of her chair and the squeaking of leather as Emma uncrossed her legs. The thigh that had been his ceiling came crashing down on top of him, driving him helplessly into the seat and squashing all hope of escape. Even through the layer of her sweatpants, the heat was suffocating, and the pressure was brutal. He could barely breathe. It felt like a punishment, but, according to Dominique, they were supposed to have a new relationship now, one where arbitrary torture was not the norm. So the only other thing this could be was carelessness. Was this really what he could expect from now on from the giantess while she had him shrunken?\n","Emma's right leg jiggled impatiently, staring at the final draft of her statement. It frustrated her that she couldn't figure out a way to wrap this thing into a neat bow that completely absolved her without involving her little toy. Aaron, or whatever.She wasn't worried about ruining her boyfriend's life if she needed to; she happily would if it would get her off the hook; but she simply didn't have the public goodwill to grind him into the dirt without consequences. Nobody in her position did, after all. She'd have the press on her side for about a week, and then they'd turn on her once Seamus started giving heartfelt interviews about their time together, and how the media assault had made things so difficult for him.She thought it was bullshit, but it was a line that people like him could run with, so she had to work around it. Unfortunately, her little sex slave had not proven terribly useful in helping her craft her line, so he just had to watch. Or wait. He was still on her chair, she knew, but she wasn't particularly concerned with where.Finally, she slumped back into her chair and let out a sigh. She only had two choices. Keep Aaron out of it entirely and enlist her publicist to do damage control, or trust that everything Dominique had told her about the shrunken man was true so she could come out with her reputation intact. Lies were involved either way, but lies told by two people had far more weight than lies told by one.She couldn't do anything about it. In a few short minutes of angry typing, she adjusted her statement so that its legitimacy leaned entirely on the word of her new 'boyfriend,' hit Save, and stood up, looking down at the chair.\"Hey,\" she said at the two-inch figure still lying spread-eagled on the leather of the chair. Where had he been? Under her ass? Oh, that'd be funny. \"You've got work to do, so study up.\"She sized him all the way up, but slowly, so he could slide out of the chair and onto the floor, then adjust himself as he slowly grew to full height; he'd likely break something if he just exploded to six feet tall in an instant. As he gradually settled into his full size, Emma grabbed his bare shoulders and guided him into the chair, pointing him at the screen. \"You see that? Memorize it. You'll be saying it to the press tomorrow, so you better learn it back and forth, right?\"For good measure, she pushed the chair as far up to the desk as she could, and leaned forwards, placing her head on his shoulder. \"Right?\" she muttered into his ear.He nodded. \"Yeah,\" he replied. His voice was pathetically weak.She reached down with her left hand, across his body, and gently toyed with the flaccid, squishy package between his legs. \"You're mine,\" she said. \"Remember that, love.\"She could already feel his dick hardening beneath her hand, so she kissed him on the cheek and stood up, drawing her hand away. She gave her fingertips a sniff as she turned on her heel and headed back to the kitchen to put the kettle on. Strange, she thought; she couldn't help but give it a second sniff; it kind of smelled like her. Was that because of what she had subjected him to, or was it her own imagination?She sniffed her fingers again, but decided to forget about it. She gave one last look at Aaron, scanning the computer screen, before ducking into the kichen. He was a great dildo, but he gave great dick, too. Just thinking about it made her a little bit horny, and knowing that she could act on it without any consequences, or without having to give a single shit about what her sex slave thought about the matter, only made the prospect of a good fuck seem more attractive. He was her property, in totality. If he didn't have the endurance to fuck her to her satisfaction, she could just shrink him down and use his entire body to finish the job. But what would be better? Dildo first, then dick? Dick first, then dildo? Dildo, dick, dildo? Hell, she could even take over his mind, and live the reality that she knew thousands of perverts on the internet longed for, fucking an unconscious Emma Watson. The opportunities provided by her absolute control over his body were intoxicating, and her fantasies bordered on the impossible. But she still had a nagging worry about his loyalty. Dominique had promised her the moon, but she still didn't buy it. She still had that note he had written squirreled away in her jewelry box, and she had studied it over and over again, the sloppy handwriting hiding the truth of her shrunken sex toy; Aaron had a devious mind and a persistent will. What if Dominique had missed the mark? Emma was starting to think that she'd be better off wiping her toy's memory and starting fresh, but it was too late for that now. She needed him to show face to the media. There was no time to blank his mind and retrain him. Like it or not, she had to deal with him as he was.She set the teapot on the stove and turned it on, spinning around and heading back into her office. She stopped on the way back into the office, looking at him from behind the corner, spying on him as he stared intently at the monitor. Come on, little guy... Pull up a police hotline, Google 'Emma Watson.' Show me you still want to escape.Nothing. He seemed dedicated to memorizing her three hundred word presser. She sighed, and shimmied off her sweatpants, then stripped off her hoodie, then cast both into the corner of the kitchen. She was wearing panties, but not a bra; she could lose the underwear as well, but guys went crazy for even the smallest bit of hidden skin. And that's what she wanted; for him to go crazy. She turned the corner and walked back towards her desk from the kitchen. She put a little extra strut in her step, hoping that the bounce of her breasts would catch her slave's eye, but he was still focused intently on the monitor as she entered. He barely broke his gaze until she put a hand on his bare shoulder.When she touched him, his eyes snapped up to meet hers, then glanced down, as if thinking better of it. The speed of his reaction, the bright look in his eyes, and his submissive self-correction told Emma all she needed to know. He was broken, but he was still smart, and dangerously so. She could trust him, but she should be careful, until she had earned his fullest devotion.And what was the quickest way to a man's heart?She pulled the chair away from the desk, just barely, swung her legs over his, and settled down on top of his lap, facing him directly. His crotch was barely inches from hers, and heat seemed to fill the space between them. And the smell... Oh, God, it was intoxicating in its intimacy. She had had a plan, a Machiavellian scheme to use sex appeal to cement his compliance, but now she couldn't help but think about how much fun it would be to carry that deception to its orgasmic conclusion.\"You're ready, right?\" she purred, running the knuckles of her left hand along his jaw. Her right hand was gently tickling his balls, and the stimulation was clearly getting to him. She could feel his hips shifting under hers, and she could feel, as her fingers explored the shapes and textures of his genitals, that her gentle massaging was... getting to him, or so to speak. \"Say you're ready,\" she breathed into his ear.\"I'm ready,\" he gasped back.His dick was rock hard, and Emma slid the crotch of her panties to the side, then pushed her hips down on top of it. Her eyes rolled back in her head, and she gasped. God, the way it filled her... It was divine. Vaguely, she heard him utter his own involuntary noise of pleasure, but it wasn't his pleasure that she was concerned with.Slowly, carefully, watching the junction between their legs as his dick quietly slid into her body, she settled down onto his lap, until she could rest her entire weight on his naked thighs. With her toy's cock totally buried inside her, she let out a desperate, pleasured gasp, and finally opened her eyes to look at him.He seemed absolutely captivated, frozen in disbelief. Like he either didn't believe what was happening to him, or he didn't understand it, or he just didn't know how to respond. In response, she bit her lip, and put on the horniest look she could, looking him dead in the eyes. He met her gaze, and she slowly slid her hips up and down. The sensation of his cock sliding in and out of her was absolutely divine, but what she really wanted was for him to take control, to show her what he was capable of. He had done it before, his vigor had stunned her, and she wanted it again.His hands were still hanging loose at his sides, like he didn't know what to do with them. She paused, her weight fully resting on his, his dick as far inside her as it would go, and slowly wove her fingers through his. She kept the look on him the whole time in that moment of slow intimacy, and he offered no resistance as she placed his hands on her hips, than placed her hands on top of his. Her hands on his hands on her hips, she arced her elbows back, stretching her shoulders and all but shoving her breasts into his face. Her eyes staring into his, not a single sound between the two of them, the wordless invitation was deafening.Have your way with me.In a single, subtle motion, Aaron finally showed that he had picked up on it. His left hand shifted down, just barely, and his thumb hooked around the crotch of her panties, pulling even further to the side. Emma stared at that place where their hips met, watching him do it, and was taken off guard by his right hand coming up and gripping her ass. She let out a surprised little squeak, and Aaron smiled at the sudden reaction. Despite herself, she couldn't help but smile back. And, apparently, Aaron took that as a cue to absolutely let loose.With strong arms holding up her weight, and nimble hips, he thrust his cock forcefully into her from the seat of the chair, over and over again. Emma collapsed into the rhythm and force of her life-sized toy, falling forwards against his chest as he continued, with a noisy, slapping sound, to drill his dick into her body over and over and  over and over again.Then Aaron stood up straight, hoisting her into the air with a small grunt of effort. His penis was still deep in her vagina, and Emma wrapped her legs around his back instinctively. It felt, for a moment, like he was wearing her. It almost made her giggle. Then he deposited her on the desk top, and, with both his hands firmly on her hips, and her legs spread wide, he set to absolutely pummeling her.Emma could do nothing but moan, leaning her weight against Aaron's sweaty body, her voice shaking with every rapid thrust. The desk banged repeatedly against the wall, the monitor shook so violently that it was at risk of falling over, but neither of them cared in that moment. Emma was consumed with pleasure that mounted higher and higher with every thrust, and her sex slave was focused on one thing, and one thing only.It wasn't long before the driving pleasure drove Emma to orgasm. Her fingernails dug into Aaron's back, her legs squeezed tight, and a helpless gasp escaped her lips. She tried to stop him, to earn even a second of relief as his cock drove in and out of her, but there was nothing she could do while weakened by ecstasy.Instead, she shifted her mind into his. It was almost effortless, but it was extremely jarring. Everything shifted all at once, sight and touch, the wordless sense of where her arms and legs were, even the seemingly-insignificant feeling of her tongue against her teeth. She didn't do it often for that very reason, but this was an especially shocking transition, as her mind entered Aaron's mid-thrust.The ecstasy she felt in her own body was replaced instantly with a ferocious hunger, a hunger that could only be satisfied one way. Aaron was pumping away, seeking nothing but that final release; Emma could recognize her own backside in his vision, but he wasn't even looking at it. His sight was blurred, his entire body seemed to be on autopilot. All he wanted was release, and, through heat and sweat and motion, he would have it.She could take control. She could own those arms and legs, she could make that driving dick her own. But she knew that doing so would be a pale imitation of someone who really wanted it. So she was just along for the ride. Being present but not in control was mildly claustrophobic, but any discomfort was buried underneath the physical exertion and sexual desperation that she now shared, wholly, with her living sex toy. Caught in the whirlwind, she allowed herself to fully become him.She had been here before, so she knew what an orgasm felt like in his body, but it still stunned her how quickly the pleasure began to build, and how orgasm seemed like such an inevitability even before it happened. It was only a few short seconds between when she could first start feeling it, and when her... his.... entire body tightened with mind-numbing, body-shaking pleasure. His cock flexed repeatedly, and she could feel the cum squirt out with every contraction. In that brief moment, it felt like she had transcended mortality and achieved the divine. And then it all came crashing down. Aaron let out an involuntary moan, and she had allowed herself to get so wrapped up in his mind that it came as a surprise that it sounded like a man's voice, and offered a few more, forceful thrusts, until the overwhelming stimulation became too much, and he finally stopped.Emma snapped back into her own mind before he could pull himself out of her, and pushed herself off the desk, driving him back down into the chair with a noisy creaking and a surprised grunt. She could still feel the warm afterglow of another orgasm that her own body had experienced while she was too busy  enjoying the experience from behind her sex toy's eyes. And, despite literally not doing anything, she found that she was tired and sweaty as well.They both sat there, panting heavily for a few long, happy moments. His dick was still deep inside her, and it felt like the heat of it was filling her, even as it slowly began to soften. A mischevious thought occurred to her; those last few thrusts after his orgasm had been so overwhelmingly pleasurable that he couldn't handle it anymore, and, living in his mind for them, even she was glad that he had stopped. But, with his dick still hard, it would be trivial for her to lock out his motion and start riding him herself, force him to experience that sensation.That would be for later. After apparently two orgasms, she couldn't really bear the thought of further stimulation either. Maybe she could start with a blowjob, and then try to bring herself to orgasm on top of him after he already came. Or maybe she could let him control her body, and experience that exact same thing from his perspective. Again, she felt a small thrill thinking about the endless possibilities offered by a willing sex slave, and that was besides the total control that she had over his size as well. She still wasn't fully trusting of Dominique's promise that he was totally willing, so she didn't want to put him into situations where he could be totally in control, but she had to admit that even the prospect of changing places with him, letting him use his own shrunken body as a sex toy while she lived it, had a certain naughty appeal.She wasn't sure how long she would want to keep enduring the kind of humiliation she had put him through in their first few days they had spent together, though. If she shrank him down, right now, and slid him into her vagina, how long would she tolerate trading places with him? Wrapped in flesh, breathing a hot, slimy mix of both male and female bodily fluids, totally unable to know what was happening or what was coming next? Actually, right now, the very thought of it made her breathe a little quicker. Couldn't hurt to experiment, right? Just for a little while?She caught his eye briefly, and thought better of it. The last time she had given him that kind of control, he had immediately devised a way to escape, one that it was only through sheer dumb luck that she had caught before anyone else did. Dominique's promises aside, she still wasn't ready for that sort of thing yet. Finally, she lifted herself off of him. His dick, now only half-erect, slipped out of her with a soft sound, and with it came much of the fluid that had been dammed up inside her.  \"Get up,\" she ordered; her voice wasn't as hard as she wanted it to be, still reeling from the ecstasy of moments before. \"You can go shower up now. I've got to finish up this presser.\"A little hesitant, a little confused, Aaron stood up out of the chair, and worked his way around Emma. He seemed afraid to ask for clarification, or even to make eye contact, but she stared at him long enough that he eventually seemed to get it, and slinked away to the bathroom.She watched him go, partly because it was fun to do so. Once that ass of his finally sauntered out of sight, Emma sat back down in the chair, right on top of the wet spot that had spilled out from between her legs. Already, the thin puddle of fluid had cooled down to the point that it felt vaguely uncomfortable when her vulva pressed down on top of it. She could clean it up, or she could simply order her sex toy to clean it up. Hell, she could shrink him down and force him to breathe it, pressed into the leather beneath her weight.His body was hers. That's all that really mattered to her. From the other room, she heard the shower kick on, and, for some reason, the sound of it gave her a sense of satisfaction. She had ordered him to clean himself up, and he had no choice but to comply, and he had absolutely no idea what she had cooked up for him next.Frankly, neither did she. But it was fun to dream.\n","It took a few days before Aaron finally realized that Emma didn't really know what it was that she wanted with him either. He was shifted unpredictably from full sized, to toy-sized, to microscopic, and it seemed to follow no pattern and was done without any of his input whatsoever. He knew that he only had about a week before he was going to be able to see Dominique again, but, with Emma exploring her role as his mistress, and him forced to go along like he actually wanted to be her slave, it felt like an eternity. Put the kettle on.Fuck me raw.Do the laundry. Sleep inside my asshole.Give me a massage.Pleasure me from inside my panties.Clean the dishes.Aaron was jerked back and forth between humiliating subservience to her sexual desires, absolute boredom, and literal slavery. Over the course of a single week, he was doing her chores, he was being used as a dildo, or he was left to linger for hours of nothing in whatever place she felt was safe storage when she was busy doing other things. Sometimes it was in the darkness of her underwear drawer, sometimes it was in the heat and stench of her actual underwear.But she never really let him out of her reach. He suspected it after the promise that he would be giving her press release live and in person never materialized, but it became clear that; she didn't seem to trust him being anything more than a few seconds away from being literally under her thumb. Whatever Dominique had promised about his obedience, she didn't seem to fully believe it, and it meant that he wouldn't have been able to try an escape anytime soon. If she ever let him into her mind, it was rare that she gave him control over her body. He couldn't tell if her mind was in her body with him, but he did notice that she never left him completely unsupervised, if only by his own body. If she had to leave him out of sight for a while, she did it at a size and in a place from which he would never really be able to escape. If anything, she seemed most comfortable leaving him in his own body, at some diminutive size, trapped somewhere on her body where he was completely subservient to her.In her underwear was clearly her favorite. Top or bottom, bra or panties, she liked to leave him barely an inch tall and pinned against steaming-hot flesh by a tight cotton prison. He was already tired of it, but he had to endure multiple hours of it a day, sucking down the stink and often the fluid of her, completely at her mercy for when she decided to let him free, or to do something a little more... energetic with him.The night before she had to finally drop him off with Dominique for the first time, she shrank him down to half an inch and left him on the carpet of her bedroom. She turned it into a game, promising that she would allow him to accompany her full size if she managed to go through her full morning routine without finding him. He tried his best to hide, and spent the first thirty minutes after her alarm went off cowering in a tiny nook between one of the feet of her bed and the carpet.But she found him, of course, and while she was only half-dressed after getting out of the shower. She didn't bother changing his size or even explaining herself, she just popped him into her mouth and spent the next hour and a half sucking on him like a piece of hard candy, showing him every part of the inside of her mouth, an overactive tongue tossing him about like a rubber ducky in hurricane-churned waters.He was almost at Dominique, though, that's what he told himself. The only person in his life now who treated him like a person, the closest thing he had to a friend anymore. And his only chance out of this hellish, sex-addled life. Maybe he'd have to endure another week, maybe two, maybe even a month or so, but she would save him eventually, right?When his saliva-soaked prison finally opened, and Emma's forefinger and thumb pinched his tiny body off her tongue and pulled him into the open air, he was honestly expecting to see Dominique there. Instead, it was Suzy. Full-sized and wearing a loose-fitting bathrobe that made it very clear that there was absolutely nothing underneath it. When she saw his tiny body trapped between Emma's fingers, she broke into a wide, almost overjoyed smile. But, at his size, all Aaron could see was the snarl of a predator.Ah, fuck.If anyone asked her, if she ever had the chance to write a memoir about this shit, Dominique would say that she forced herself to live in Suzy's body as she exacted absolute humiliation on the shrunken man after Emma dropped him off. She had to know exactly what was happening, she would say, both to make sure it couldn't get out of hand and to remind herself of the moral weight that rested on her shoulders.But it couldn't get out of hand, she knew, the shrinkee was functionally immortal. And, truth be told, some part of her deeply enjoyed it. She could never do to these people what Suzy seemed to relish doing, and, even if she could get away with doing it to Suzy, even if she could bring herself to do it, her own little shrunken woman would love the experience. So the sense of humiliation, of absolute domination wouldn't really be there.These were thoughts she tried not to think. It made her concerned that she wasn't in this for the right reasons. But she couldn't deny that she felt the same thrill that Suzy did when she bid Emma farewell and immediately tossed the tiny man into the rubber cone that fit on the head of her Hitachi vibrator and started to masturbate with it.Suzy wouldn't even experience anything unique having the little man there, and all he would experience would be a few minutes of painfully violent, noisy vibration. But it was about the domination. She wasn't pleasuring herself with his body, but with the knowledge that his body was her property. But Suzy, with a seemingly limitless sex drive and a desperation to please her mistress, carried it just a bit too far as usual. One orgasm wasn't enough for her; she spent a few seconds gasping in the bed after the first, and then went for a second. Then, after her whole body heaved in the throes of another climax, her bathrobe slipping off her shoulders, she plucked the tiny man out of the rubber cap, and instead put him directly on her clitoris, underneath the vibrator, for yet a third orgasm.Dominique didn't need to stick around inside Suzy's mind. She didn't have to watch everything that she did with Aaron's miniscule body, but she chose to. She told herself noble reasons why she did so, but the truth really was that, at some level, she liked it.When it was all over, Dominique returned to her own mind and walked into the kitchen. Suzy, her face flushed with pleasure, tiny man trapped between her palm and the mattress, looked up at her with adoration. She had no idea what Dominique actually thought of the whole thing; her expression said plainly, \"Did I do good, mistress?\"\"Well done,\" Dominique said, bending down and giving the other woman a kiss on the forehead.Suzy beamed. She looked down at her hand, raising her palm just enough that Dominique could see the poor little bastard trapped underneath it, then she looked up at Dominique as if she was revealing some carefully-guarded secret. God, in all her years doing this, Dominique had never met anyone as enthusiastic about size play as Suzy. For practical reasons, Interpol couldn't ensure that she would be paired with someone who had her same mission when she started this job, but she had anticipated someone who had been shanghaied into the Program against their will. She had not been prepared for the bizarre, undeniably pleasurable experience of an eager, willing servant.Suzy had thrown Dominique's entire world into question. She still held hard to her mission, but she was constantly plagued with doubt. How many of the people shrunken by the Program were as eager as Suzy? How many of them had volunteered for it? Or what if she was a spy, and her eagerness was being used to coax blackmail from Dominique? God knew that her seeming love for her job had brought Dominique to tolerate some... less than savory things. She had even done things that she never would have done if she knew that her shrunken partner wasn't loving every second of it; was all that part of a strategy as well?Dominique remained committed to her job, but she couldn't shake the feeling that she had been... polluted somehow. That, even if her witness would be accepted in a court of law, it would be received somewhat less favorably by St. Peter. That's what made Aaron so important to her. Maybe saving him would provide redemption for her as well. \"Leave him to me,\" she told Suzy.Suzy hopped to her feet; Dominique couldn't help but glance downwards when her breasts bounced up at the energetic motion. The other woman noticed her glance, and drew her bathrobe over her shoulders, looking up at Dominique with a playful sort of bashfulness. She drew close, fillng the space between them with the heat that radiated from her bare skin, and reached up on her tiptoes to give Dominique a peck on the lips.Dominique smiled in return, almost sincerely, and Suzy wordlessly lifted her hand to present the shrunken man like a gift. The little guy was a pathetic sight, smaller than her palm, stark naked and curled up into a fetal ball. She knew that it was her job to help him, but he seemed so helpless, so weak...With both her hands, she lifted Suzy's hand to her mouth, and slurped up the shrunken man like a piece of candy. Suzy's mouth opened in shock and excitement, and Dominique grabbed the back of her head with force, and brought their lips together.Suzy exhaled in surprise, but folded into Dominique's grip without resistance. The other woman's tongue wormed into her mouth, buffeting against the microscopic man and introducing him into a world of true chaos.At some level, Dominique knew that she had to keep track of Aaron. She couldn't let Suzy lose him or, God forbid, swallow him. At the same time, she didn't really care what happened to him. If she had to explain herself, she could just brush off whatever she did as necessary to maintain appearances, and he wouldn't know any better. Hell, if she seemed apologetic enough, he might even appreciate her for it. But, today, Aaron's size was on a schedule. Dominique dislodged her tongue from Suzy's mouth, and she made sure that the tiny man was carried along with her. As their lips parted, Suzy looked up at her adoringly, seemingly waiting for what she would do next.Dominique had a mouth full of shrunken man, so she couldn't just tell the other woman to go away. Instead, she put her hand on Suzy's shoulder and turned her around, then gave her a light slap on the ass.Suzy hopped up at her touch, letting out a light gasp and drawing her bathrobe a little closer. She looked over her shoulder at Dominique with a mischevious expression, but she seemed to take the message. She put as much swagger in her step as she could, practically begging Dominique to come back to her, but she did finally make her way to the door. She turned back, blew a kiss at Dominique, and finally vanished.Dominique locked the door behind Suzy and glanced at the alarm clock on the nightstand. 18:59. Shit. She spat the little man out of her mouth and into her palm, and dumped him onto the rumpled bedsheets that Suzy had vacated barely a minute ago.Only a few seconds later, Aaron exploded into the person that he actually was. Dominique wiped the spittle from her mouth, admiring the tight, muscular body that the shrinking process had left him with. But, God, he had been in her mouth not seconds before. There were some safeguards, but when you didn't control a toy's size... \"Welcome back,\" she said. She lifted her own bathrobe off the hook on the back of the door and held it out for him, inviting him to cover up if he wanted. He leaned up and glanced at Dominique with a skeptical expression that made her worry, for a second, that she had lost whatever trust he had placed in her, but he took the bathrobe and let his gaze fall to the floor. As he draped the pink terrycloth around his shoulders, it was not lost on Dominique that he was bigger than her, stronger than her, and probably very frustrated with her. He would only have the size advantage for about an hour; keeping him full-sized any longer would arouse Emma's suspicion; but the door was locked, Suzy was certainly out of earshot, and there was a lot that he could do in fifteen minutes if he wanted.Hopefully, all he wanted was a friendly chat. \"How was the week?\" Dominique asked.He sighed. \"Not what I expected,\" he muttered, still looking down at the floor.Seated at the end of the bed, slumped over and naked beneath Dominique's ill-fitting bathrobe, he cut a pathetic figure, somehow even more so than when he had been helplessly small in the palm of her hand. \"How so?\" she asked.\"She just... uses me,\" he complained. \"I don't know what she wants, she just does it.\"\"She doesn't know either,\" Dominique told him soothingly. \"And she's not sure if she can trust you yet.\"\"I do everything she asks,\" Aaron protested.\"I know, it just takes time,\" replied Dominique. \"And you'll get a feel for what she wants from you as well.\"\"But I don't want to be her fucking slave!\" he yelled back. \"I just want this to be over with.\"Dominique sighed. \"I know, I know. But it takes time.\"\"How long?\" he demanded.\"Months, I think.\"Aaron groaned and fell back onto the bed, and Dominique continued, \"If you try to force it, it'll take longer. And, the more she trusts you, the more you get to live a normal life.\"\"As a slave.\"\"But not shrunken,\" Dominique told him. \"She has more use for you at full size if she can trust your loyalty.\"\"She still uses me as a fucking sex toy.\"\"And she probably will in the future. But being used as a dildo for a few minutes is better than being two inches tall and stuck in her sock for eight hours because she can't trust you out in public,\" Dominique said sternly. \"It's not just about getting free. It's about earning a less shitty life for yourself in the meantime.\"Aaron sighed again, and rolled off the bed to his feet. Dominique held her ground as he stepped up to her; even slouching, he loomed over her, seemingly filling the room. Who was the shrunken one here, again? \"What can do you?\" he asked, spreading his arms helplessly.\"I can hurry it along,\" Dominique answered. \"I tell her that you can be trusted, that you're eager to please, that you just have to be given a chance.\" \"Okay...\"\"But you have to promise me you'll actually do that,\" Dominique continued. \"That you won't bolt the first time she leaves you alone in her flat.\"\"Fine...\"\"And I might be able to convince her to give you some autonomy when we meet next week,\" she finished. \"Can you do that? Can you wait for a week?\"She could see Aaron grinding his teeth. The last week must have been miserable for him. Surely it hadn't been as bad as how Emma had treated him before bringing him to Dominique and Suzy, but there was something about hope that made suffering even worse. \"Do I have a choice?\" he asked finally.\"The choice is to wait a week, or to wait a month,\" Dominique answered. \"Trust me. Go along with it.\"In response, he just shrugged, and Paige turned her back on him to procure a measuring tape from her nightstand. Even though, in more ways than one, his fate was in her hands, she still felt keenly vulnerable alone in a room with him. She found herself racing to find the measuring tape to keep her back to him for as little time as possible. \"Arms out,\" she commanded, spreading the tape and turning around. Despite her fears, he had not taken those few moments with her eyes off him to strangle her from behind. He was still standing there, looking sorry for himself.\"What?\"\"Arms out,\" she repeated. \"I'm going to measure you for clothes.\"\"Why?\"Dominique looked up at him like she couldn't believe how dense he was. \"Because, if you have something to wear full-size, she's more likely to make you full-size more often. Now, arms out.\"Finally, he complied. As Dominique took his measurements, she explained, \"I'll grab a set of clothes and give them as a gift to her next week. I'll tell her to find an occasion to let you wear them, and that you can be trusted out in public. You can make my job easier by making sure that she'll actually believe me when I tell her that.\"\"Okay...\"\"Fortunately,\" she continued, \"You have a body worth showing off with the right fit.\" She leaned down and reached into the folds of his bathrobe to measure his inseam. She was careful to let the back of her hand brush up against his junk when she did so, and she heard him take a sharp breath. \"Like what? A French Maid outfit?\" he asked.Dominique snorted. \"Is that what you'd like? I don't think you can pull off fishnets.\"\"Couldn't hurt to try.\"She reached up to take his neck measurement, and he looked back down at her with the closest thing to levity she had ever seen on his face. She looked back up at him, into his bright blue eyes, and was shocked, for a moment, by just how open he looked. How honest. God, he was practically a kid; what did he do to deserve getting wrapped up in this?She cleared her throat and pulled the tape away from his neck. The moment of intimacy was over, and she felt dirtier for it. Tomorrow morning, she'd be giving this man back to Emma, who believed that he was not only her property, but that he wanted to be. She certainly wasn't the cruelest mistress, but it wasn't an enviable position for anyone with even the gentlest owner. Aaron, for his part, seemed to notice that he had crossed some line, and quickly cast his gaze downwards. It just made Dominique feel worse. If she actually gave a shit about him, about the person that he was, she'd do something to save him from this life of slavery as soon as she could. But, in all truth, what could she really do? \"Alright,\" she said, putting on a businesslike air, \"You've got until the top of the hour at this size.\" She stuffed the measuring tape into her pocket and made her way to the bedroom door. \"Kick back, relax, whatever. Emma will be back to pick you up in the morning. Do you need anything?\"Aaron seemed a bit overwhelmed by the sudden shift in her attitude. \"Uh...\" he began.\"Great. Just let me know,\" Dominique said. WIth that, she ducked out of the room, and slammed the door shut behid her.Ah, fuck. What was she doing with her life?\n","Aaron had to keep his hands clenched in fists to keep them from shaking. No matter how deep he inhaled, it felt like he could never get the air all the way to the bottom of his lungs. He was about to have a panic attack, but he also had to seem like everything was normal, so every breath was a concentrated effort to suck in as much air as he could as quietly as he could manage. Emma didn't seem to notice, or, if she did, she didn't seem to care, quietly studying the back of a book she had pulled seemingly at random from the shelves of the political science section. He loomed over her, he knew, his eyes fixed on the back of her neck. Her slender, fragile neck, bare underneath hair pulled up into a frizzy bun. If he was quick enough... Could he do it?She made a quiet noise of disapproval and put the book back on the shelf, tracing her fingers across the spines as she looked for a new one. The temptation to try to take her life to gain his freedom disappeared in a wave of guilt and futility, and he took a quiet step back so she would be less likely to notice his labored breathing.Emma had dragged him out shopping to serve as combination valet and pack mule. In any other circumstance, with any other woman, it would have just been a boring trip, the kind of thing he would just endure for the sake of their relationship. He might even try to break up the tedium by trying to be mildly annoying. But right now, alone with her in a bookstore, gripping a bag full of new clothes in his left hand white-knuckle tight, it was something very different, something sinister and terrifying.It was the first time he was outside with her, in public, full-sized. The first time he was able to make a break for it, or to call for help, but trusted not to. It was the kind of thing that Dominique promised she wanted out of him, but that he couldn't believe she would ever do. So he had been in the throes of a slow-burning panic attack the entire time. Maybe he could swerve the car into incoming traffic? Maybe he could go for the neck? Could he knock her out in a single swing?  Maybe he could just start screaming and force her to shut him up? Anything to get out of this. But something held him back. He knew she had extraordinary power over him, and for everything he thought of, he feared that she had thought of it as well, and was ready to put a stop to it before it would do anything. And, one she knew that he wasn't really as loyal as she assumed he was...It was the punishment that would follow that he really feared. Emma selected a book on the history of feminism in Ireland and started leafing through the pages. Just then, Aaron heard a voice, high and excited, from behind him. \"Are you Emma Watson?\"Both he and Emma turned to look at the newcomer in unison, Aaron struggling to keep his face level, and Emma transitioning effortlessly into 'celebrity-meeting-fan' mode. The voice beloned to a tall, raven-haired woman with angular features and Crossfit limbs, who was in the middle of producing a phone from her handbag. Emma smiled at the thirty-something stranger like she had known her all her life. \"Hey there!\" she said. \"Oh my God, I loved you in Harry Potter,\" the woman said, \"Do you mind if I get a selfie?\"\"No problem,\" Emma replied, all cheer and smiles. \"Aaron, do you mind?\"The woman took the cue and handed Aaron the phone. Help me, she's using me as a shrunken sex slave, he thought. He felt there was an opportunity here, but he was helpless to imagine how he could use it.The two posed together, bending forwards and heads together, with mechanical camera smiles, Aaron took two pictures, and handed the woman back her phone wordlessly as Emma and her new best friend separated to study the photo's quality.Apparently satisfied, the woman put her phone back in her bag and looked up. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" she said, looking back and forth between Emma and Aaron, \"My name's Kathy.\"\"So great to meet you, Kathy,\" Emma gushed, as if she was the fan and this stranger was the movie star.\"Aaron,\" Aaron croaked. She can control my size. I've been stuck with her for months. Please, call the police.Emma's face hardened almost imperceptibly when he spoke. Kathy didn't notice, but Aaron did, and his heart sank as he realized that telling another human being his name had bought him a world of hurt.A few more niceties, another selfie, to his surprise, and Kathy was quickly on her way. Aaron wasn't really present for all of it, he was running on autopilot because his mind was spinning with fear and regret for having inadvertantly crossed Emma. Once Kathy left, and they were in the relative privacy of the bookshelves, Aaron dreaded what would come next, but Emma just kept perusing the shelves for new books. Every move of her arm that he thought would send him plunging down into a new microscopic size, lost in a sea of clothes that used to fit him, was just her reaching for another book.God, he felt like a battered housewife, cringing at every move. He hated it. He hated the fact that he knew it, he hated the fact that was afraid to do anything about it. But he still did nothing about it. Because, no matter how much he hated it, he was more afraid of what would happen if he tried to do something about it.But, to his relief, nothing really happened. Emma walked out of the store with two books on feminism and a cookbook, and Aaron was feeling just spiteful enough to think that that was ironic. He was tasked with carrying them as well, of course. They piled into her car, and he set to driving them back, down narrow London streets, to her spacious flat. He worried all the while that she would eventually express her displeasure, scared that every move that she made was her finally deciding what she was going to do with him, and taking action. He wouldn't have any warning about shrinking, of course. It would just happen. And then she would just do whatever the hell she wanted with him. Could he already smell the overbearing, humid stench that wafted out from between her legs, or was he just imagining things?But nothing happened. Nothing happened for the whole drive home, nothing happened after he parked the car and pulled the keys. Nothing happened when he closed the door behind them on the apartment. And nothing happened when Emma retreated to her room with her books, leaving him to take care of putting away all the rest of the bullshit that she had bought.He would shove it all down the garbage disposal, if she had one. But something about his odd new task was strangely encouraging. If even his misdeeds didn't mean that he would be stuck with his face up against her asshole for a week, then maybe he could stomach this new reality. Maybe he could endure whatever she wanted to do with him when she got horny, so long as it meant that he could spend the rest of his time full-sized and more or less autonomous.He was still a slave, though. He couldn't forget that, and he wouldn't. But Dominique was going to solve that problem for him... eventually. In the meantime, maybe... maybe he could actually live like this? As he was busy packing Emma's new clothes away into a closet, his limbs suddenly froze up. He stood there for a moment, panicking at the fact that none of his limbs were answering to his commands, before his body started moving without his consent, moving with purpose but with awkward form away from Emma's closet and towards the closed door of her bedroom. He realized relatively quickly that Emma had decided that she was horny, but was too lazy to even bother commanding him to come to her. She could just hop directly into his body, take control, and bring her to him without him being able to do a damn thing about it. The feeling of his limbs, his entire body, acting completely without his control was frightening and claustrophobic, but he couldn't fail to realize that she was also sending a message about what she could do.It was a message about the futility of any attempt to escape. As soon as he had that realization, his reality span in a horrifyingly disconcerting way, and he found himself on a bed, sprawled out on soft sheets, with cool air on his bare skin below his waist. No... Not his waist. Her waist. Emma had put him in her body, and, when he propped himself up on his elbows to take stock of what just happened, he realized that she had left him in control of it, while she was living in his body. He had done this before, but it was still bizarre; Emma was him, and Aaron was her. But before she had the chance to think too long about what she could do while inside her new body, the door swung open, and she was left facing her original body, naked but for a pair of socks, filling the doorway. The feeling of vulnerability she suddenly felt, the weird pang of fear, was nothing she had ever really experienced before. She felt a keen sense of how thin and naked this new body was, and how strong Emma's new body was while looming over it, with a cocked smile of intent on his face. She had never felt that discomfort before, in all this time with Emma, or even in the brief times she had spent inside this body. That person looming overhead... He was going to have his way with this weaker body that she was living in now, and there was nothing she could do about it.She knew, in some way, that the fear he felt in the pit of his stomach at that realization was stupid. She was literally his sex slave; in an instant, Emma could swap back into her own body, shrink his body down, use him as a dildo, and throw him in the trash. But there was something about the sight of it...She took a shaky breath and tried to smother that instinct. Trying her best to keep eye contact with Emma, she lifted her knees and spread her legs, inviting the cold air to wash between the sensitive, naked flesh. Every nerve in her new body screamed to close her legs, to tighten up, or even to try to run away, but she knew, even as his chest shook with anticipation, that it was totally futile. Any act of protest, any act of resistance, and Emma would take control in an instant, and exact brutal and humiliating revenge.His dick swung at half-mast between his legs as he stepped slowly up to the bed; Emma was wearing his new body with the absolute confidence of the partner who knew they were dominant. Meanwhile, she was just trying desperately not to shake visibly; she must have looked like a pathetic creature by comparison.His body leaned down and wrapped a hand around each of her thighs. At the sudden, rough touch, she draw a sharp breath, shaky and uncertain with fear and anticipation. Her gaze was locked to Emma's as he lowered his head between her legs, and she felt a sudden, body-wide tingle when a tongue gently slid between the lips of her pussy.The gasp that escaped her mouth at that sudden sensation was one more of pleasure than fear. God, even that little hint of head felt good. She was holding onto a fistful of bedsheets in both hands with all her strength, desperately trying not to move and to just let Emma do whatever it is he wanted to do down there.But what she wanted to do was to make it very hard to keep still. He could feel every movement of the tongue between her legs with electric clarity, as it probed the sensitive flesh, parting her labia and massaging the delicate, intimate parts beneath. But somewhere down there, his tongue applied insistent pleasure to something that felt very, very good, and he heard herself let out involuntary moan, sounding almost as if it had come from somewhere else.Was that the clitoris? Whatever it was, Emma sucked briefly at it, until Aaron couldn't take the intense pleasure anymore, and her hand moved, seemingly on its own, up to his head, trying to push it away.In response, Emma grabbed her her wrist and forced it down to the bed, and she lifted her hips voluntarily when he guided her hand underneath her ass. She sat down on it, and the licking and sucking got even more intense. It was all she could do not to squirm away, but the message was clear; don't move, just sit back and enjoy it... Or else.Fuck, though it was hard. Her legs lifted off the bed, hugging her thighs to her chest, presenting him with everything, and he took advantage. With his tongue insistently focused on her clitoris, he took his hand off her thighs and slowly, deliberately, slid his middle two fingers into her vagina. Aaron couldn't see what was happening between her legs, and she didn't expect it to happen, and she let out a surprised, squeaky gasp at the sudden penetration.Of course Emma knew exactly what buttons to push, and he pushed them good and hard. Aaron fell wholly into his touch, losing all trepidation with the insistent stimulation, and also losing the ability to hold still amidst pleasure that tried to snatch away control of her limbs. Feeling pressed for breath, she stopped hugging her thighs to her chest, and they found their way around Emma's head, her knees hooked over his shoulders, seeking to draw him in like a spider pulling in its prey. In a gentle rebuke, Emma's free hand, the one that wasn't doing absolutely incredible things inside her, pushed back against the back of her left thigh, so Aaron let it hang it in the air. The first orgasm came after what felt like a lifetime of buildup, and her mind went totally blank. Her body tightened up until she could barely even draw breath. Whatever her limbs were doing was totally out of her control. And, still, there was an unyielding, electric pleasure that felt like it was striking at the the depths of her soul. She loved it, but she had to escape it, she just had to breathe...And then it all came crashing down. She drew a ragged breath, half a moan, and looked down to see that her thighs were spread wide, one of Emma's hands planted firmly on the back of each one, leaving her pussy totally exposed. But his mouth was finally, blissfully removed. Instead, Emma was standing upright, smiling a grin smeared with glistening fluids, and noticeably erect.Just a minute, please, Aaron begged silently, too breathless to speak. But in spite of her desperation, or maybe because of it, Emma decided that it was time for more. In a quick, almost predatory motion, the hands snapped down to her hips and dragged her forwards across the bedsheets, until her ass slammed up against his pelvis with a wet thwack, leaving her legs propped up like fenceposts against the front of his chest. Aaron watched with fascination as Emma took full advantage of her vulnerability. Both their gazes were locked at that junction between their legs, and Emma slapped his cock against the bright pink, glistening-wet peach of Aaron's vulva. It was a barely pleasurable sensation, even while still coming down from that absolutely incredible orgasm, but the moan that escaped Aaron's mouth, totally involuntary, was one of raw hunger.How on earth could Emma be that good? He hadn't had the body of a man for more than, what, five minutes? But, as if he had been doing it all his life, he only needed his thumb to guide his cock down as he tilted his hips back, and slid himself all the way inside her.Aaron gasped, and her head fell back like a doll with its strings cut. The feeling of it going in... It was more than pleasure, it was being made whole. Her body moved without reason, seemingly without input, tilting her legs and hips to allow him to go even deeper, and he took the invitation by firming his grip on her hips, pulling almost all the way out, and slamming himself all the way back in. Emma quickly found a rhythm of pulling and pushing, of in and out, of Aaron's bare flesh jiggling as it bounced up and down on the mattress, and skin slapped noisily against skin, over and over and over again.Aaron's moan shook with the thrusting in a way that sounded amusing even to her own ears. When the moan ended and she inhaled, she couldn't help but giggle at it, and that giggle was strangled into a breathy squeak by a sudden wave of pleasure that made her entire body convulse. Then Emma groaned, and pushed in deep with one last thrust when he came. Aaron felt the heat of his cum shoot into her with stunning clarity, so little, and yet it felt like it filled her entire body. Buried as deep into her as he could get, their hips flat against each other, she felt his cock flex once, twice, three times, and then, breathing heavy, he finally pulled out.Aaron moaned like he was taking a part of her soul with him as he did so. Breathing heavy, skin slick with sweat, Emma staggered a few steps to the side, and crashed down on his back on the bed, right beside Aaron. And then they both just lay there, gasping desperately for breath, as the pleasure receded and the world slowly came back into focus around them.No words, barely any motion. Just breathing. Sweat drying in the cool air, their naked skin so close together that Aaron could feel the heat of it, a warm and human smell so strong that it had body all its own filling the room. Then, without warning, everything changed. The change wasn't too particularly large, but it was huge because everything changed. Aaron's perspective shifted just slightly to the left, but her body became heavier, larger, the body radiating heat beside her was suddenly on her opposite side, the pleasant soreness between her legs was replaced with a deeper, broader exhaustion, even her teeth felt different against her tongue...No, not her... Aaron was him again. It seemed like she... he... had acclimated to the new, temporary body almost too quickly.A brief, rogue thought crossed his mind; did that mean he was getting used to being Emma's living sex toy?Beside him, Emma stretched like a kitten, letting out a soft moan through her nose. Aaron expected to be shrunk down and cast aside, or put inside, but, to his shock, Emma snuggled up beside him, and threw a single arm carelessly over his chest. \"Hmmm,\" she breathed. \"Did I come twice?\"Aaron's breath caught in his throat. He seemed to have forgotten how to speak. Maybe not a sex toy after at all. Maybe this was a real relationship...? Was that even any better? \"Uh, yeah...\" he croaked. He hardly even realized that he had lied. Emma gave a deep, satisfied sigh, and, as he lay there, her breath started to fall into a soft, steady pace, as if she was about to fall asleep. And then he started to shrink. It was slow, and the shock of how open and intimate she was being at that moment prevented him from recognizing it until he found that his head was at a level with her clavicle. Suddenly, whatever sense of comfort had evaporated, replaced with raw panic. Instinctively, he tried to squirm away, but Emma's other arm wormed underneath him, her elbows folded in, and he found himself squeezed up against her naked chest in a bone-crunching hug. He kept shrinking, and the arms that grabbed him grew larger and larger, until he finally stopped. One hand unwrapped from his body, and he didn't see where it went until it brought the blankets down like a curtain on both of them. Aaron was barely two feet tall now, his head no higher than Emma's sternum, so he was washed in darkness as she shouldered the blanket up to her neck and wrapped her arm back around him.She let out a satisfied sigh, and he could feel it at his back. The firm embrace of her arms pinning him against her soft, delicate chest. The gentle rhythm of her breathing, in and out, in and out. The steady thump-thump of her gradually slowing heartbeat. The oppressive heat and heady stench that seemed to come from everywhere all at once, and quickly growing now that it was all trapped under the blanket with him. Like so many times before, his claustrophobic panic quickly gave way to a more manageable boredom once he realized that there wasn't any chance of escape, and that there wasn't really any harm in where he was either. If anything, it would be worse for him if he tried to escape. So all he could do was lie here and wait, cuddled up in her arms, for her to wake up and let him free.It was better than the worst thing, he supposed. But it was also surprising in how it combined her casual disdain for him as a shrunken person, and unprecedented tender intimacy. He wasn't a sex toy, he was, what? A teddy bear? After she had let him accompany her in the real world, at full size. After she had let him enjoy what sex felt like for her body, he wasn't sure anymore what he was to her. Was this relationship starting to become something more normal, like Dominique had promised?Or was he starting to see it as normal?\n","Dom had done it.Emma was still deeply suspicious of her shrunken toy's motives. She had seen him fight back, recoil from her touch, even try explicitly to escape. She knew what he wanted and what he was capable of, but she had been willing to trust Dominique's process, to give the man a chance at being the person she wanted him to be. And, put frankly, she had been surprised.She still retained the right to wipe his memory entirely. Knowing what she knew now, she could make a pliant slave even without an expert's assistance. But, God, it helped to have an expert doing the work.Aaron... She had to get used to thinking of him by his name instead of simply as her toy or her slave... He had been her willing escort out in public, in front of strangers! Though not of her own volition, he had been given the chance to betray her, and had turned it down. And then, behind closed doors, he had willingly given her the most unbelievable sexual experience of her life. It didn't matter that it had happened in the confusing world of him being in her body, and her controlling his. She had given him total control, and he had done exactly what she would have wanted with it, and more.So, put simply, Dominique was a miracle worker.Emma had spent countless hours fantasizing about this exact thing that Dominique had given her. About a man who could be at her side at parties, who could live in her underwear, and who could fuck her raw. Who could be her date, her dildo, or her jewelry, all as she demanded, and be willing to fill every single role at every single size. It was every woman's dream, but now it was her reality. She still felt the need to be careful. To let Aaron out in public in steps, acclimate him to the spotlight, and acclimate herself to the idea that her sex toy could live out in the real world literally minutes after being buried head to toe inside her vagina. But Dominique was trustworthy. She had proven the quality of her work, if only by the slavish devotion that her own slave, Suzy, had to her giantess.Emma contemplated all this, her prospective future with the tiny man that was now her property, with her arms wrapped around him like a living teddy bear. Against her strength, there was nothing he could do, so he was largely still. She may have even fallen asleep with him in her arms, but it was hard to tell. Some time after thinking about him, their future together, and what Dom had done for them, she woke up with a start, taking in a sharp breath of air.The tiny man was still squeezed up against her chest, his head between her breasts and his feet somewhere just south of her belly button. She let out a soft, satisfied noise, and squeezed him a little tighter to her ribcage. Emma thought about sizing him back up, but had a bit of a naughty whim, and decided instead to roll over on top of the tiny man. Arms still tight around his teddy bear-sized body, she pinned him to the mattress under her weight. His entire body was suffocated under hers, his every limb trapped under her weight. She knew it, and she felt quite pleased about it. Just to make sure it was what she thought it was, she closed her eyes and shifted her mind into his.Immediately, she was transported into a world of suffocating pressure, smothering heat. Skin surrounded her on all sides, enveloping her in near-perfect darkness, and keeping her from even budging her arms and legs. The transition was so jarring, the experience so claustrophobic, that she immediately shifted back to her own mind.She was left disoriented, and feeling a little bit guilty, so she rolled off of Aaron, unwrapped her arms, and kicked the blankets that covered them both down to her knees, leaving him to rest unmolested on her bare chest. She watched him lie there for a moment; his eyes were closed, apparently pretending to still be sleeping; as his smaller body rose and fell with her breaths. He was adorable, and so full of promise as her new toy, servant, boyfriend, or whatever she wanted to call him. She smiled, and ran the tip of her finger down his naked back, prompting a shiver from his tiny body. Maybe coworker, someday? Who knew? But, no matter what, he was hers for life.She transferred herself back into his mind, and, this time, the only thing that felt different was that the small patch of heat that was his body against hers grew into a massive blanket of heat, from her body surrounding his. Emma was starting to get used to being in Aaron's body, to being a him. The weight of his body felt so different; the higher center of gravity felt unstable, and the reduced flexibility and the increased sensitivity to physical discomfort left Emma feeling somehow more vulnerable. But the strength in his limbs, along with the mental knowledge that men could just get away with so much more, combined to create a confused sense of whether being in his body or hers was any better. All Emma knew was that it was different.Someday, she would take his body out into public, live her life as him. She might get some insight into how men were treated differently by society than woman, but she suspected that it was more likely that she would just learn how much non-celebrities were ignored out in public. And that could be convenient, too. Sometimes, she just wanted to get some fresh veggies without a stranger asking to take a selfie.But now... Now it was just an intimate moment, of being able to explore her own body as a tiny man. She slowly shrank his body down, feeling the heat emanating off her own body drawing closer and hotter, until it was almost unbearable. Aaron's body was barely an inch tall at this point, and Emma's own body, effectively asleep without her there to pilot it, was an endless field of smooth, bare naked flesh. It was a sight that Emma had never really seen before, and it was absolutely fascinating. She thought she knew her own body, but to see it like he saw it was something completely new. The perspective was so alien that the imperfections that she normally obsessed over didn't seem to exist. It felt as if she wasn't even on her own body, but that of a total stranger. A thin, pale-skinned, slight-breasted stranger, with flesh underfoot that trembled with every heartbeat, that rose and fell with every breath.She was somewhere just north of the navel of the sleeping goddess, so there were only two ways to go. Up, to admire her breasts as monuments, or down, to become more familiar with the intimacy that Aaron had already spent days enjoying.The choice was obvious. Emma turned around without a second thought and started making her way carefully down towards the giantess' hips. At this size, her weight was small enough that her feet barely left an impression in the giantess' skin, so it was like walking on sand on the beach that had been packed firm by the waves. The only difference was the way that it sprang back when her weight came off, and the burning heat that met her feet when they landed. It was so, so, so hot. If she hadn't been in this body literally seconds ago, she would have thought that it was feverish.The tan line on the sleeping titan's skin was barely visible at this size, but the line where the pubic hairs started to grow was much more obvious. Despite the fact that Emma had literally shaved yesterday, there was no hiding the growing stubble at this size. But it was no impediment to her journey to the cliff's edge, to the mound of flesh, still swollen red from an incredible fuck, that marked the giantess' most sensitive organ.As she reached the precipice, she fell to her knees and approached at a careful crawl. She knew that nothing would happen if she fell, but she still had an 2instinctive fear of falling. The giantess left leg was straight, but her right was cocked outwards, providing just enough of an opening to expose her pussy to the open air, and to Emma's curiosity.The flesh grew even hotter as Emma approached, leaving her sweating in the swampiness of it. And, finally, she reached the edge. Freshly-shaved stubble was rough like gravel under her hands, and she stared down at a sheer cliff of wrinkly, pink flesh. It was alien in its shape, its colors, and its thick coating of slimy, shiny fluid. At this size, at this scale, it barely even looked like a piece of human anatomy, even though Emma knew it was her own body. Thick, creamy white fluid oozed out of the bottom of that massive feature, with a hair-thin strand connecting it to a glob that had fallen loose just an inch below, to the smooth, pale skin of the giantess' ass. Emma wanted to dive right in. She wanted to experience, firsthand, what it meant to be shrunken in that world of flesh and bodily fluids. And she could. At this size, she could clamber down the massive walls of flesh, force herself through the sticky fluids and fight her way into the depths of her own massive body. Hell, she had total control over her own size in this body; she could size herself up or down, whatever she needed to make it easier to shove herself in there.Or, if she was daring, she could let Aaron take control of her own body. And he could shove her in there. That cloudy white trickle of cum that was oozing out of the giantess' vagina... It was hot as hell, and it presaged what she could experience if she was reduced to the toy that was appropriate for her size in this borrowed body. Without a thought, she found her hand wrapped around the cock of her borrowed body, stroking slowly and imagining what it would be like to be inside there. The heat, the flesh, the salty suffocation of drowning in cum...There was no way that Aaron, or at least this body of his that she had borrowed, was turned on by the thought of being drowned in his own ejaculate, but Emma thought it was the hottest thing on the planet. Her arousal... This rock-hard dick in her hand... She gave the borrowed cock a few strokes, but she felt a desperate thirst...She turned around, and sized herself up enough that she was sure that her voice in this tiny body could be heard, almost two feet tall. She was almost straddling the hips of her own body by the time she was big enough, and, with her borrowed cock still hard and resting on the smooth flesh below her... Well, she had a sudden thought of going for another round in Aaron's body before she tried this. It had barely been thirty minutes since she had just done that, and Aaron's body was already capable of being turned on. Honestly, it was impressive, and a promising sign for his future as her personal sex slave. But she passed it up. She could always do that again later; she wanted to be inside that cum-filled pussy right fucking now. She let Aaron slip into her own body, and then gave him control of it. The only sign that he had taken over, at first, was the way the giantess' eyes snapped open, and then she took a deep, almost desperate breath, so violent that it nearly bucked Emma right off her perch.\"Hey!\" she ordered. The bassy, male voice that came out of her mouth was a shock, and gave her a moment's pause. Fortunately, Aaron seemed as out of sorts from his sudden transition into her body, and took a while to fix his attention on her. By the time his eyes met hers... or hers met his... She had already recovered and taken control.Fuck, these pronouns... When she was in this body, erect dick in hand, staring up at the breasts and pussy of a giantess looming overhead, Emma had no idea whether s/he should think of herself as her or he... She reveled in the strength of the male, she inherited a lot of the chemical attractions inherent to being a man while she was in Aaron's body, and she even felt a bit more confident while baring his nude body to the world, but so much of her brain still said that she was a woman.     Fuck it. She was she, he was he. Emma was a she, even if she was using her throbbing dick to fuck some woman senseless, it was still her doing it. And, for now, Aaron was a 'he,' even if his wet pussy was getting creampied.Oh, shit. Emma could totally play the bar scene in Aaron's body. Spend the night at a stranger's house, maybe even take advantage of her size control. The possibilities were endless!But that was for another time. For now, Emma only wanted one thing.\"I want you to use me,” she ordered the giantess over her.Aaron, his mind behind the eyes of Emma’s own body, looked down at her with confusion. “How?”“As a dildo, dummy,” she replied, giving a few half-hearted thrusts with her hips. The motion did uncomfortable things to her testicles, trapped between her body and the giantess underneath her, and she screwed up her face and had to adjust. “I’ll shrink down, I want you to cum.”With that, Emma shrank down to what she already knew was a comfortable size for her to masturbate with Aaron’s body, while still holding a firm grip on it. Maybe six inches or so? The flesh beneath her quickly surged up to meet her. And, just when the shrinking stopped, the giantess’ hand came out of nowhere, slamming into her back and wrapping around her tiny body.The massive fingers curled around her form with shocking familiarity, as if the giantess had been expecting a human-shaped dildo of her exact form and size for her entire life. The massive fingers that coiled around her legs like sentient snakes made sure that there was no way she could fight against the massive woman’s will. And then, with a stunningly deft motion of the massive woman’s fingers, Emma found herself flipped upside down, and then she was being carried about in a world of chaos and motion. Almost immediately, Emma found her face shoved up against the burning-hot, slick-wet flesh of the giantess’ pussy. The sudden surge of motion was terrifying, overwhelming. The slimy fluid that had seemed so far away just a minute ago coated her face. Raw, animal panic surged, making it feel like she was suffocating, sending her limbs thrashing, and almost leading her to pull the plug and return to her own body.But, by now, she had experienced enough at this size that she could quell the panic, at least partly, so she stayed in the shrunken man's body. The noise, the heat, the fluid, the flesh everywhere... It was overwhelming. The only reason Emma even knew what was happening was because it was the very same motion she made when she was about to start masturbating. The giantess slid her down, then up across the exterior of her pussy three times, both getting her soaking wet and making sure that she was fully between the lips of her labia, then it was one more push across the slick flesh, and she was plugned bodily into the burning hot embrace of the giantess' vagina.It was like entering another world. The heat was unbearable, the pressure of the flesh inescapable. And the fluid, the cloudy, sticky mix of cum and lube and who knew what else, filled every space the flesh did not, drowning her in burning heat. The entire universe had been replaced by an undifferentiated mass of pink flesh and white fluid. And the giantess wasted no time in using Emma as the dildo she had asked to be. Her body had already been worked up by the sex, it could swallow the living dildo without complaint.And it felt like being swallowed. The textured walls squeezed her body tight, and she felt the heat and the pressure plunge down all the way to her knees, then ride all the way back up to her neck. For a n instant, Emma felt the chill of the outside air on her freshly-soaked skin, and then she was consumed all the way back down to her knees again, all in less than a second.The noise, wet flesh slapping and sliding and squelching against more and more wet flesh, was deafening. The heat was stifling. The flesh hugged her face like latex, unless she was able to wrench her head far back enough. But, even then, the only thing to see was a tight fold of flesh parting to invite her deeper into a tight fold of flesh, forever, and drowning in cloudy, salty slime. She learned quickly that she had to keep at least one hand on her dick to keep it bent upwards, because the force and speed that the giantess masturbated with would bend it excruciatingly far downwards, making an already torturous experience even worse. It was weird that, while being drowned and beaten by her own giant body, she would worry about the discomfort it caused to her borrowed penis, but that's what being in a man's body did to you, she supposed.It was so fast, so brutal, and each thrust felt like it was the last one, or at least Emma hoped that it was. But each time she thought that she was about to get a breath of fresh air, she was plunged all the way back inside the giantess.The urge to give up and go back into her own body was growing stronger with every second. She persisted only out of stubbornness, she wanted to experience everything that the tiny man did, until the very end, and if she gave up now, it felt like she would be admitting that she was weaker than he was. But the giantess was lasting forever! It never felt like it took her this long to cum, but at this size, the rhythms of her own body felt like they lasted ten times as long. She heard the first moan, as if from a million miles away, and knew that the end was near, but with it also came the first squeeze of the giantess' pelvic muscles. The pressure from all sides seemed to increase a hundredfold, leaving the blood pounding in Emma's ears, and yet even that did not stop the giantess from ripping her tiny body in and out, in and out, in and out. And with more and more ferocity as she got closer to climax. Emma honestly thought that she could handle it, but the contractions kept coming, faster and faster, and the one that came with the giantess' orgasm was like nothing she could have prepared for. After more chaotic ripping through the burning-hot flesh, she abruptly stopped moving, and she let herself think for a moment that the giantess had given her a reprieve. But then the flesh turned to steel and clamped down hard... harder... harder!Emma panicked. She flailed, but couldn't move an inch. She gasped, but nothing, not even the fluid that surrounded her, entered her mouth. The pressure grew and grew, causing real pain that she hadn't yet felt at this size. She could practically feel her bones creaking, about to snap under the unyielding pressure of a goddess' pelvic muscles. Soon, it would all be over; she would be reduced to a bloody paste by the involuntary spasms of a massive woman's orgasm.Her orgasm.Fuck that! No! She was not going to die like this. She would not be killed by her own vagina. At the last minute, she fled back into her own mind.She was met by a desperate, breathy gasp that escaped from her own mouth. Her eyes were screwed shut, but she could already feel that she was surrounded by fresh air and bedsheets, not clenching flesh and drowning fluid. The pleasure had already climaxed, though she could still feel the tail end of the orgasm tickling her skin. Her body had already tensed as hard as it possibly could; it was all downhill from here. Immediately, Emma felt a rush of shame. She thought she could endure the most basic thing that her shrunken toy had to experience every day, but she was forced to evacuate, out of pure desperation, only a few seconds before it was done. She grodefinitely had a long way to go to fully explore her relationship with this shrunken man; if she couldn't live his everyday life, how could she expect him to enjoy his role?And yet Dominique had somehow done it. She had made a pliant servant, and it had only taken a few weeks. Maybe there were months of follow-up, and some loose guidelines for her behavior in the interim, but she had already tested those guidelines and found that her toy's behavior was resilient. For Emma, though, barely five minutes of that existence had made her certain that she was going to die. How had Dom done it?The ravages of orgasm finally passed, Emma drew a ragged breath, feeling her body go limp in the wake of the pleasure. She would have to spy on Aaron the next time he met Dominique. Live in his body for a time, see what he saw, know what the hell Dominique was actually doing to make him into a willing slave. She had to learn what kind of treatment earned loyalty, both so that she could replicate it and so that she could learn to think that way herself, during those flights of fancy when she felt like living Aaron's role in their relationship. Then, against her will, her arm reached down to grab the shrunken man stuffed inside her pussy. Emma realized with a start that, though she had re-entered her own mind, she had done so in such a desperate panic that she hadn't seized control back from Aaron. Normally, being in her own body but not in control of it was suffocating, and she hated doing it for more than a few minutes just to see what Aaron was up to. But, after that time literally suffocating inside her own vagina, the feeling of fresh air on her skin and in her lungs made her calm enough to sit back, or so to speak, and enjoy the show.Her arm, familiar in weight and motion, yet somehow just a bit alien after spending that time in Aaron's mind, lifted the shrunken man up by his legs and dangled him over her head. The tiny body, thickly covered with faded white streaks of fluid, hair matted down by the slime he had just been drowning in, flopped around totally limp. It almost looked like he was dead, and, given that there was no mind occupying that head of his, that wouldn't have been wrong.Her mouth opened wide, and her arm descended as much of the shrunken man's body into it as could fit. Her lips closed around the warm, slimy body like she was sucking a grape off the vine, and her mouth filled with the sour, salty taste that Emma had been literally drowning in just a few moments ago. Small and diluted though it was, it still almost revived Emma's panic. She swallowed, sending the glob of bodily fluids down her throat. So she was going to be enjoying that aftertaste for a while, great. It was that minor indiscretion that finally led her to take back control of her own body. She pushed Aaron's mind back into his body at the same time, forcing him to adapt to the sudden shock of being plunged into the hot, suffocating world inside her mouth.She could have pulled him out immediately. Spared him from the suffocating existence that she herself had just escaped, but... well... he was the slave, and she was the mistress. She held him in her mouth for a long, long time. Long enough to feel as the panic of being plunged into that dark, dangerous place set in. His body started to squirm, to struggle, to fight desperately for escape. But her tongue was stronger than his entire body, so he just had to endure it.Finally, after a few seconds of growing struggles, he fell still. He had accepted his place. He had so much more experience at being that size, and he could handle the kinds of things that she, frankly, just couldn't.And she loved that about him. She loved that he had the uncomplaining endurance of a rubber dildo, but also the conscious will of a man who wanted to please her. At the same time, she was deeply jealous that she couldn't endure the basic experience of her own body as well as he could. If anything, by now, he knew her body better than she knew it herself.And that wouldn't stand. If she was a dumb giant with a nimble servant, then she was certain that she was being taken advantage of. If she knew less about their combined experiences than he did, she thought that she wasn't taking full advantage of their relationship as giantess and shrunken toy. The fact that a man so small, so utterly in her control, could possible have a one-up on her, set her on edge, and made her determined to set it right.But how? She contemplated the question, sucking on the tiny man's body for an idle few seconds. She let his legs go, and they plopped down on her chin; Aaron could have maybe used that position as leverage to draw his body out of her mouth, but he just lay there. His legs, warm but so light as to barely make an impression on her skin, felt like fluid dripping down her chin, making her have to resist the temptation to suck the whole mess of his body into her mouth.She would have to set up some sort of game for herself, she realized. One that she would either win, or have to keep playing until she did. A challenge. The same kind of mental challenge she routinely set for herself while out jogging. Just keep going until the next lamp post. Only it would be far hotter, far more uncomfortable, and unbelievably sexual.Once she reached that conclusion, the rules of the game were almost immediately clear to her.She ripped the tiny man from her mouth and kicked herself off the bed all in one motion. She didn't care one bit what was happening to him now, because it was all going to happen to her soon. \"Come on, little man,\" she muttered. She was swinging her arms as she walked, and Aaron dangled from the end of one of them like the weight on a pendulum; she had no way of knowing whether he could even hear what she was saying, but she didn't really care either. \"I have a game for us to play.\"\n"],["The giantess lay on the bed, naked save for her underwear, reading a book. I, scarcely an eighth of an inch in height, stood next to one of her massive feet, trapped under the blankets with God knows how much of her body. The rest of her body seemed an eternity away from here, the smooth, tanned flesh of her massive legs providing an almost infinite pathway to her hips.\nThen, without warning, the massive woman planted her left foot down, pinning me underneath the ball of her foot, and dragged it halfway up to her hips, leaving her knee elevated, her foot flat, and her legs spread slightly. In an instant, I went from standing underneath her massive foot to being helplessly dragged, her foot pressed against my face, across hundreds of feet of bedsheets. It only lasted a second, but it took far longer for me to recover, my head spinning, my back burning, and my whole body aching. But she didn’t have much weight on her foot now, so I could gain a bit of purchase and crawl out from beneath her feet. It took a minute, but I finally freed myself and stood back up, trying to make sense of where I was now.\nI stood between the giantess’ massive, smooth legs, able only to see their beautifully-toned flesh and the crotch of the purple boyshorts that they led up to. When she raised her knee, it had caused one of the legs of her underwear to ride up a bit, exposing the darkened, clean-shaven flesh of her crotch. \nI made my way towards her body, trying to keep clear of her legs in case she moved them again, but, for the two minutes that it took me to trek across the bed sheets, she did not. Soon, I stood within arm’s reach of the seam of her underwear, wondering if I should risk climbing up or just try scaling her leg instead.\nIt was already hot under the bedsheets, but the heat here was oppressive, so I decided to climb up the leg that was still lying flat on the bed. It wasn’t hard to clamber up and over the hem and squeeze my way between the cotton and the inside of her leg, but, almost as soon as I did, she lifted her other leg, and I fell down the inside of her shorts into her crotch.\nI landed on my back in the wrinkle where her upper thigh met her crotch, and realized, to my surprise, that the flesh was somewhat wet around here. It wasn’t just sweat; she was horny, and the thin layer of fluid that was soaking into the warm skin was lubricant that she had spread around from masturbating earlier. \nI had to tread carefully. One misplaced foot and I would tumble down, over the edge, to parts unknown, and there would be no escape. I could feel the heat of her desire from here, and her massive hands, or whatever else she had above the blankets, would crush me like a bug without her even realizing I was here.\nSo I started to climb up and over, working my way towards the relative safety of her belly button, using hair follicles as hand and footholds against the almost vertical face and sleek, wet walls.\nIt felt like I was climbing for hours, but, at my size, I had hardly made it an inch up her torso. When I looked down, I could see the pink flesh of the woman’s vulva, swollen and shining with lubricant, and that meant that I was still in grave danger.\nBut then, with little more warning than a quiet moan, the giantess pushed her hands into her panties to start masturbating. I saw her fingers slide through the elastic like it wasn’t even there, and I barely had enough time to process what was happening before her middle finger struck me directly, and I was caught, helpless, beneath her fingertip as she started to masturbate.\nI should have been rolled out from underneath her fingers almost immediately, but there was so much lubricant around that it quickly soaked her fingertips, and I just slid around the giantess’ genitals under the tip of her middle finger. At first, she gently stroked her clitoris, though the action was anything but gentle for me as I was pressed deep into the soft flesh underneath the unyielding body of her finger, surrounded by gallons of lubricant and immersed in oppressive heat and stench. \nBut it wasn’t long before the woman grew tired of this motion, and she lifted her hand off her clitoris. Trapped in a viscous layer of lubricant that now dripped from her fingertips, I saw, for a brief moment, her swollen, pink, and clean-shaven vulva before she brought her hand back against her crotch and shoved her middle two fingers into her vagina.\nI was plunged instantly into a world of heat and flesh. The bright pink, textured walls of the giantess’ vagina were just barely visible between her labia, but she shoved her fingers between those fleshy curtains like they weren’t even there, and, in an instant, the distant, seemingly bottomless maw of her vagina was suddenly all around me. \nThe woman started slow, massaging the front wall of her vagina just an inch or so from the entrance. With my back pinned to the tip of her finger, the whole front of my body was pressed relentlessly into the hot, elastic flesh. The complicated texture of soft, fluid-soaked ridges enveloped my body like a living glove as the woman slowly massaged the most sensitive parts of her body. \nThen I felt her hips shift, a terrifying warning of what she was about to do. She drew her ring finger out, and then started to penetrate herself with a will. Keeping her finger pressed against the wall of her vagina, I was still trapped, helpless as playful teasing turned into full-blown masturbation.\nI was forced deep into the elastic flesh of her vagina as her middle finger rode back and forth, pressing hard and massaging back and forth at the same time. The textured flesh turned into a painful pink blur as I was driven all around her vagina, never once offered a glance of the outside world, never once given a chance to take a breath of fresh air. I swam in a hot, turbulent mix of bodily fluids as, with loud, squelching sounds, she penetrated her body with her middle finger, pushing me so deep into the flesh that I was literally enveloped by it. \nShe wasn’t able to do this long before she finally climaxed, although every second of it was unbearable torture. When she reached orgasm, however, she plunged her finger as deep in as she could and held it there. A moment later, her hips shook and the muscles that bound the walls of her vagina contracted, squeezing hard around her finger. The flesh that she pressed me into turned rock hard and pressed against my face as hard as her finger pressed against my back. In the midst of the pressure, I was sure that I was going to die, but then the contraction subsided.\nA second later, though, it came back. It was somewhat weaker, and didn’t last quite as long, but it was still nearly enough to kill me. By the time I had recovered from it, a third one came, and forced a scream of pain from my lips. But the third one was enough for her, because she slowly drew her finger out of her vagina, sliding it over the sensitive wall of her vagina as each weakening contraction pressed me against her finger.\nBut, before I was even halfway out, one of the contractions grabbed me off her finger just as she pulled it away from the wall of her vagina, and suddenly I was stuck to the thick layer of fluid that coated the walls. Her finger was gone, and, after it, the walls of her vagina slowly started to close together. The contractions had subsided into a soft shaking with every one of her rapid heartbeats. The shaking, however, was not enough to throw me out of the layer of lubricant.\nI could gain some purchase against the wall, though, pushing against the textured walls with all my might. But the soft flesh merely absorbed my hands and feet like quicksand. Still, the layer of fluid didn’t hold me very tight, and I eventually pushed hard enough that I fell from the front wall of her vagina and landed on the other side. The walls were so tight together, though, that there was barely enough room for me to stand up straight. When I climbed to my feet, I was almost able to touch the front wall by reaching up, and, closer to the entrance, it got so tight that the walls were touching. I would have had to force my way through the flesh to escape.\nBut here, with the walls shaking and the viscous fluid grabbing at my legs halfway up to my knees, my footing was unsteady. I made my way slowly forward, treading carefully over the ridges and textures of the woman’s vaginal walls. After only a few feet, I had to drop to my hands and knees to continue forward, and then, as the flesh started to press against my back, I lay down and started to push my way between the flesh, practically swimming in the woman’s lubricant.\nIt seemed like I was doing this for hours before I made it to a point where the flesh finally opened up again. I could taste the fresh air, and, climbing up to my hands and knees, I worked my way up what was a growing incline. The texture provided decent handholds, and, soon enough, I could see outside.\nThe woman’s vulva was spread open slightly, providing me a view of her legs, which were spread wide across the bed, her panties tossed down between her feet. \nAnd then I saw the dildo. A massive, pink vibrator with ridges halfway down its length. There was no escaping the woman’s body in time, so I tried to scramble back to safety, but I fell back against the tight walls, and could do nothing but watch as the woman brought the tip of the dildo against the opening to her vagina, then plunged it in.\nMy ears popped at the sudden pressure increase, and the tip of the dildo struck me right in the chest, driving me through the tight walls like they weren’t even there. About halfway into the woman’s vagina, I fell under the tip, and the dildo rode over my body, the hard, plastic bulk forcing my body into the flesh at my back. \nI got caught underneath one of the ridges and dragged out of the textured surface of the elastic walls, rolled around between the dildo and the flesh of the woman’s vagina like a mote of dust between her fingers. And then, when the woman got the thing as deep into her as she could, she pulled it out, and I was tossed and turned down the whole length of the woman’s vagina until I finally caught on something, buried facedown in the flesh, pressed relentlessly into it until the dildo finally passed over. \nIt was a painful and chaotic process, but it had only been the first insertion, and, a second later, the woman repeated it. I was dragged around the walls of the woman’s vagina, back and forth, but finally deposited closer to the entrance than I had been the first time, coughing out fluid, flesh pressed against my back and face and wondering how I hadn’t been killed.\nBut that had been relatively slow, I realized, as the giantess pushed the dildo back inside her with even greater force. This time, I didn’t have the chance to get caught on it, and was just buried into the walls of her vagina until it was finally gone. And still the woman gained speed, pushing harder and faster, driving the dildo in and out of her body with a savage will, completely oblivious to the torture that I endured.\nOne penetration would push me, facefirst, into the flesh, and then another would roll me about and deposit me somewhere else in the massive woman’s vagina.  Then my back would be pressed against the flesh as I was forced to endure the hard ridges of her dildo passing over my face.\nIt was a chaotic and painful whirlwind of motion. The massive woman fucked herself for what felt like hours, tossing me all around the inside of her vagina. In the unbearable turmoil of it all, I didn’t notice the rhythmic contractions leading up to orgasm, or even the rocking of her hips as the pleasure mounted, as I was too busy being crushed between the dildo and the walls of her vagina to understand that anything else was going on.\nBut then, just as the woman pulled the dildo out of her body, leaving me face-up against the wall of her vagina about a quarter of the way in, she climaxed. The walls around me turned rock-hard, and the one above me came crashing down as the one at my back came surging up. They met in the middle and crushed my tiny body, wrapping every limb in flesh and pressing against me with enough pressure to break my bones.\nAnd then they relaxed. My head was spinning and my whole body was sore. I just barely had enough time to recover, though, before the woman’s muscle-bound vagina contracted again, and the walls slapped back together. This contraction was far weaker and shorter than the first, but, almost as soon as the woman’s vagina had relaxed, it snapped back together. The repeated contractions, brief though they were, were even more torturous than the long one had been, because I had no time to recover, and no warning before the walls around my seized up and came crashing down around me.\nAfter half a dozen contractions, the following squeezes were too weak to bring the walls all the way together, finally offering me a respite from the torture. But then the woman suddenly sank the dildo back into her body. The vibration was off, but it still filled her vagina, and drove me almost all the way to the bottom before the ridges passed all the way over me and I was stuck between the smoother part and the textured walls of the woman’s vagina.\nShe left it there for a moment, and, above the noise and vibration of her heartbeat, I felt her entire body shiver as she let out a soft moan. Then, after a moment, she pulled it back out. She did it slowly enough that the very first ridge grabbed onto me and held, and I was pulled all the way out of her body.\nShe tilted the dildo up and dragged it along the surface of her vulva. Her labia grabbed onto me as she did so, and I was rolled violently between the dildo and her crotch, no relief provided by the thin, sticky layer of vaginal discharge and lubricant, until I wound up somewhere near her clitoris, pressed forcefully between the soft flesh and the hard dildo.\nShe slid it up and down, very slowly, and I tumbled along with it, the flesh yielding like water as the dildo pressed into it, and wrapping around my body like a suffocating, living glove as I was massaged over ever inch of it.\nWhen she finally pulled the dildo away, I was sucked off its surface by the sticky fluid on her crotch, and left trapped between the lips of her labia, my head and shoulders sticking out but the rest of my body held tight. I was too tired to try and break free, and too small to succeed even if I had tried. \nThe giantess had the covers off now, and her boyshorts around her ankles. Watching from between her legs, I was a captive spectator as, with terrifying speed for her size, the massive woman swung her legs off the bed, stood up, and bent down. When she bent over, her vulva was squeezed and shifted between her legs, and the lips that held me fast seemed to push me out a bit. Now, I was only trapped from the waist down, my arms free. I stood a chance of escaping, but I would have to move quick.\nThen the woman stood back up. At that moment, I was thrown free from the lips of her labia, and, at the same time, I saw the crotch of her panties coming up fast. I fell into the cotton hammock of her boyshorts only a second before they came up and met her crotch.\nAfter but a breath of fresh air, I was pressed back up against the woman’s crotch, breathing in the hot, heavy fumes of her womanhood and soaked in the bodily fluids that slowly dripped from her insides. She adjusted her panties, pulling the waistband up around her ass and fastening it between her legs. The tight cotton surface pushed me up, and I was wedged into her vulva as it was tightly seated in the crotch of her boyshorts.\n","Buried deep inside the woman, with the only parts of my body not surrounded by flesh resting against the tight cotton of her panties, I was completely trapped, but the woman seemed finally done abusing my tiny body. With no risk of being trapped in another one of her masturbation marathons, I may have stood a chance of escaping, but, after a few minutes of struggling in vain between the lips of her labia and the elastic of her panties, I decided that it wasn’t worth it right now. The things that she had done to me had left me sore all over and deeply tired. \nThe blanketing heat of her flesh and the distant, steady pounding of her heartbeat were, now that the chaos had come to an end, somewhat soothing. And I soon drifted off to sleep, trapped in the folds of a giantess’ vagina, deep beneath the protective layer of her panties, as she went about her day. Nobody, not even her, knew that I was there, and, in some way, I felt safer as a result.\nI was woken an indeterminate amount of time later by a sudden light and a flood of fresh, cool air. Groggy and only able to see the outside world through a thin gap between her labia, I was unable to figure out what was happening. I definitely knew that I was deeper than I had been before, and there seemed to be more fluid around me than there had been as well. What had happened? Had she peed and wiped, pressing me even deeper? If so, how had I not noticed until now?\nThen, without warning, something massive slammed into me, instantly driving me deep into the woman’s vagina. At first, I thought she was masturbating again, but then, when the walls of the woman’s vagina pulled me under the massive, hard object and left me to suffer being rolled between its rough textures and the elastic walls of her insides, I realized that the purple head, the fleshy wrinkles, and the spiderweb of veins could mean only one thing.\nShe was having sex, and I was caught in the middle. \nIt was far too late to escape, and futile to even try to find a safe spot. The man who was fucking her thrusted in and out with force and purpose, his massive dick spreading the walls of her vagina like a latex glove, sliding effortlessly in and out with a steady and consistent rhythm.\nI was trapped in the middle of it all. If anything, this was worse than the dildo. The man’s penis was not as large and didn’t have the same ridges, but the shape of the head meant that I was scooped up as he pulled out, and deposited somewhere near the entrance. Then, as he thrusted back in, I was rolled around between the body of his dick and the rough, textured walls of the woman’s vagina, squashed between the giant and the giantess like dough under a rolling pin.\nIt was a torturous process. All I could hear was the pounding of the two heartbeats and the deafening squishing and squelching sounds of soft flesh and lubricant sloshing around amidst the driving force of the man’s cock. I was contorted into impossible positions amidst a whirlwind of motion that left me impossible to figure out which way was up. My world was heat, flesh, and chaos.\nBut the worst part was when the man finally finished. In the moment before, I was caught up at the tip of his head and finally deposited, at the apex of the thrust, on the walls of the woman’s vagina. Trapped in lubricant, my back against the giantess’ flesh, the opening to the man’s penis was pointed down, right at my face, so close that I could almost reach up and touch it.\nAnd then, without warning, a torrent of fluid rocketed out of it. I was caught up in the flood, and washed around in a milky white mix of lubricant and semen as the man filled what little space was left inside the woman with his hot fluid. After the turbulent flow was over, I found myself surrounded by a thick glob of budily fluids, trapped between the walls of the woman's vagina and the shaft of the man's cock.\nJust after the motion finally ceased, the man slowly pulled his dick out of the giantess. At no point did I come in enough contact with the vaginal walls for them to pull me off, and, suddenly, I was out in the open, swimming in a massive drop of viscous, white fluid through which I could barely see the outside world. I started to panic, wondering what would happen to me now that I seemed to be attached to this stranger, the giantess’ lover. Would it be any better than being stuck inside her body?\n","After some time of chaotic, bouncing motion, the world grew still enough that, through the haze of the man’s sperm that surrounded me, I figured out where where I was. I could make out the fuzzy image of the shaft of his penis, his dangling testicles, even the pale, hairy columns of his legs. I was stuck underneath the head of his dick, the underside that no man ever bothered to look at.\nSuddenly, there was another, nauseating burst of motion. Insignificant to him, I was sure, but even the tiniest wiggle of his cock was pure chaos to me. Then, trying in vain to blink away the translucent fluid that coated my entire body, I saw that the giantess was on her knees, her face right in front of me. I realized, in the split second that I could see it, that the giantess that had tortured me, whose insides I had thoroughly explored, was my innocent-looking blonde coworker, Kristin. \nAnd then she wrapped her mouth around the rapidly-softening cock of her lover. I was once again enveloped in darkness, only barely able to see the moist pink of her mouth and the white of her teeth. Her tongue came slithering up and slimed its way across the shaft of the man’s penis, its tip coming to an end at the head and pulling me off with the glob of fluid that I was trapped in.\nI could see, through the mix of lubricant, semen, and saliva, as the man’s cock slid back out of Kristin’s mouth and her slips sealed shut behind it. Then she moved me, with the gallons of fluid that I was immersed in, to the back of her mouth, and, with a mighty gulp, swallowed me down.\nI was pushed down her throat in a second, and landed in her mostly empty stomach. The walls, heavily wrinkled and slick with fluid, heaved and writhed at my entry, tossing me up and town and coating my body with acid.\nI couldn’t feel the burn, though. My suspicion that I was invincible was confirmed as the walls of the giantess’ stomach beat at me in a futile attempt to digest me. There was a horrifying possibility that I could be trapped here forever, unable to die and unable to be processed by her body. I beat desperately at the walls, and they beat me back, knocking me around and slowly passing me further down. \nEventually, though, I was squeezed out of her stomach, and spent the next few hours traveling through the giantess’ digestive system. I was unable to fight the inexorable current of her body, and carried along like mere food until, what felt like an eternity later, she finally passed me.\nI was stunned, though, to find that Kristin turned around and fished me out, picking me up between her thumb and forefinger and washing me off in the sink. “I hope you enjoyed that,” she told me. “Because you get to do it again.”\n","My eyes widened, and I drew a breath to put words to my shock. She knew? She knew the whole time? She knew that I had been her unwilling plaything, that I had been caught in her body while she made love? She knew that she had eaten me?\nBut, before I could speak, she put my body underneath the sink again. Even that meager flow of water was, to my tiny body, an incomprehensible deluge of water. The stream struck my body with force that should have shattered my bones, and her fingers held on to me even tighter, but I felt no pain. I was not even offered the release of death.\nEven though I had sucked down gallons of water without consequence, I still coughed and sputtered pathetically, gasping for air, when she pulled me from the stream. But, before I could catch my breath, she stuck me under again. I had no idea how long this torture lasted.\nWhen I was thoroughly cleaned, she popped me into her mouth without delay. I could barely process my transition from the cold torrent of water to the suffoccating heat of her mouth before she swallowed me right back down again.\nI spent the next few days traveling through the giantess’ intestines, being slowly pushed through the dark, tight passageways of her body, surrounding by the rumbling of the muscles that moved me along, the sloshing of the intestinal fluids that surrounded me, and the constant, steady pounding of her heartbeat. At least a dozen times I was squeezed out of her asshole, cleaned off, and sucked right back down her throat.\nIt was never pleasant, and I never seemed to need food, water, or even sleep. I was awake, trapped in an eternal nightmare as I toured the massive woman’s digestive system, bathing in stomach acid without dying, breathing in thick fluids without drowning, and somehow able to see everything in a dim light that came from nowhere.\nI lost track of how many times I was eaten before she finally decided she wanted something else from me. She never told me what it was, though. After cleaning me off, she just brought me down between her legs, her free hand spreading the lips of her labia and exposing the pink flesh beneath, and stuffed me clumsily into her vagina. \nI rode the tip of her middle finger deep into her body, and, when it departed, the flesh closed hungrily around me. Even at my tiny size, they hugged me tight, and, while I could gain some small amount of purchase against them, it would take a very long time before I would actually get anywhere, and, with the cold speed that she had inserted me, it was hard to tell which way I would have to go to actually get out of her body.\nThe walls here were damp, a pink color and a ridged texture that was quite different from the inside of her intestines. There was very little space here, as well; rather than being suspended in an inexorable current of digestive juices, I was held fast by the elastic walls of the giantess’ vagina. Pools and bubbles of fluid sat in what few empty cavities there were, leaving me soaked from head to toe in the discharge that coated the walls in a thin sheen.\nHere, there were no muscles trying to work me in either direction, no sounds of sloshing fluids, just the thumping of her heartbeat, each pulse vibrating the walls ever so slightly, and the very clear, irregular pounding of her feet hitting the ground, her hips shaking back and forth with each step she took.\nThe heat, the fluid, the vibration of the walls and the much more present feeling of motion as Kristin walked around made the prison of her body feel even more alive than it had when she had been eating me. I had never been here in a situation where she was just going about her day, and it was terrifying.\nI had to escape. Even being eaten was preferable to this. I started to push against the walls, squirming and kicking, desperately hoping that I was moving in the right direction, and that I wasn’t stimulating her enough for her to realize what I was doing, or, worse, enjoy it.\nIt took a great long while before I really started moving, and, fortunately, the giantess didn’t seem to respond to it. I slowly squeezed through the living, vicelike textures of the massive woman’s vaginal walls, with each inch feeling like a mile, and, after what felt like hours, I managed to push myself into a tiny little chamber.\nMy heart dropped when I saw the firm, smooth surface of the giantess’ cervix, glistening with fluid and with a tiny orifice in the middle, far too small for even me to fit through, and with a slight smear of blood in it. I was as deep inside of Kristin as I could get, and there was no way I’d be able to escape from here.\nWhat I hadn’t noticed, however, as I had struggled in exactly the wrong direction of freedom, is that the walls around me had grown warmer, the heartbeat that beat at my tiny body had grown faster. The fluid that flowed from the walls was clearer, less viscous, and came in greater volume. The fact that the little chamber I was in even existed should have been warning enough, but I didn’t recognize the signs until it was too late.\nSomething absolutely massive slammed into my back, rolling me around chaotically between its hard body and the elastic walls of the woman’s vagina, and driving me hard right onto the woman’s cervix. It pressed down on me hard, seeking to drive me into the hole that I certainly wouldn’t fit in, and then it pulled away.\nIn the instant between when it was no longer pressed against my face and when the woman’s vagina closed up behind it, blocking it from view, I saw the purple, wrinkled head and narrow slit of a penis. I realized what would eventually happen, and, trapped in the viscous layer of fluid that coated the giantess’ cervix, I was helpless to do anything about it but wait.\nWhoever Kristin was having sex with was truly enormous, to be able to push so forcefully against the very bottom of her vagina, but he had restraint as well. The head of the penis never struck me again. I just saw it thrusting in and out of the woman’s vagina, pushing the walls aside and sending a spray of Kristin’s own vaginal lubricant into the void that surrounded her cervix, then withdrawing and disappearing from sight with a squelching sound.\nIt didn’t take long for it to be all over, but Kristin and her lover both reached orgasm at the same time. I felt the vibration of her screams through the walls of her vagina, and, unbelievably, the opening to her cervix beneath me opened up slightly, sucking me down into it as the muscles surrounding her vagina seized up, pushing the cervix that now held me fast forward, right in front of her lover’s penis.\nAnd then he climaxed. The spray of semen was like a firehose of white, striking me with such force that it drove me further into the woman’s dilated cervix. Suddenly, I was trapped up to my waist, and then the opening relaxed, clutching me with force I hadn’t believed possible.\nActing seemingly with malicious intent, the woman’s cervix pulled away from the head of the man’s penis at the same time, and then, when the next contraction of the woman’s orgasm came, it slammed back down on top of the man’s dick, driving me further in like a nail under a hammer.\nThe man withdrew a bit by the time Kristin’s next contractions came, and I was caught in a heaving mass of flesh, Kristin’s cervix bouncing up and down as her vaginal walls clenched tight. I was amazed that so much of her body could move that fast, but, realistically, it was probably no more than a centimeter or so of motion. \nBy the end of it, I was still trapped, but drowning in a mix of vaginal fluids and semen. My arms and legs were pinned, held so tightly that I couldn’t believe that they hadn’t broken. I had been squeezed through every orifice in her digestive system, but nothing so far had held me this tight. The shallow breaths that I was able to take with such pressure were no more than the disgusting feeling of the hot, slimy bodily fluids running down my throat. I wished desperately that I could drown.\nBut I couldn’t. I could never die. I would just be trapped here until something shook me loose. But that came faster than I anticipated. After the orgasm subsided, the mound of her cervix started shaking up and down again, plunging me over and over, through the pooling fluid, towards the bottom of the fleshy chamber. Through the walls, I could hear her giggling, and each little laugh was accompanied with a soft clench of her vaginal walls.\nI was shaken free almost instantly, flung from the walls that held me tight and driven down into the thick, viscous layer of mixed bodily fluids that coated the giantess’ insides. I was helpless to escape, and, honestly, was too tired to even try. I just lay there in the hot fluid, carried along with it as it the giantess’ every motion stirred it around. She continued to laugh occasionally, and the shaking of her vaginal walls pummeled me repeatedly and sent the mixture of semen and lubricant flowing anew. \nThere was nowhere to go but down. I was carried along with the fluids through walls that had been stretched by the exercise they had just undergone. And, eventually, I found myself face-up in the damp cotton of her panties.\nNot long after I had dripped out of the giantess’ vagina did the world around me start to shake violently, and suddenly there was light as she dropped her underwear to the floor. The damp cotton and the thin layer of fluid that had pooled in it clung onto me, and the movement didn’t shake me off at all, even as she picked up the panties and brought them up to her face.\nKristin saw me, there was no doubt, but she didn’t say anything. She just brought the wet crotch of her panties up to her face and licked me off, taking a sizable drop of fluid with me. I sat on her tongue inside her mouth for a moment before her tongue tilted back, I fell down into her throat, and she swallowed me down.\nI never knew any other life since the first time I had found myself under the Kristin’s covers. She ate me over and over again, her intestines a living prison that never lost its terrifying heat and noise. The only time I ever had relief from that world was when she stuffed me into her vagina. Not long after that, I would be ravaged by a massive penis, left to lie in her lover’s slimy fluids until she decided to recover me, and then I went straight back into her stomach.\nIf I wasn’t caught in the middle of sex, I was being eaten alive. I spent the rest of my life inside Kristin. \n"],["\"So, everyone, we’ve pulled together some money from the last few months and bought a new toy for the house,” Suzy said. “I would like you all to meet the newest member of our house.” She held up, for everyone to see, the naked, six-inch tall woman, who stood proud and unashamed in her hand, although she did have a little trouble keeping her balance at the sudden motion. “Holly.”The little girl waved at the crowd of thirty or so sorority sisters in front of her. Once a six foot tall, amber haired twenty year old, she had taken a job with X-Mart at the introduction of their human sex toy line. They paid an exorbitant amount of money for her to live as a shrunken-down woman for a few weeks at a time, free to be used as a sex toy by the clients who rented her. She got to choose who her clients were, and she had so far limited herself exclusively to women. This was her first gig in a college town, though. Where she was from, her clientele had largely been wealthy housewives and lonely single women. Keeping this many women happy would be quite the challenge.Holly had smooth, tan skin, hairless from the neck down; a fortunate side-effect of the shrinking procedure. She had a thin, athletic figure, with relatively wide hips and shoulders to match. Her muscled legs ended at her hips in firm, round buttocks. Her slender stomach and thin waist led up to a pair of grapefruit-sized breasts that hugged tight to her chest, with lean, strong arms. One of the benefits of the procedure was that, while she was shrunken, she aged much slower, if at all, and her athletic figure was much easier to keep.“Holly is our living sex toy, on rent from X-Mart,” Suzy continued. “She’s very comfortable with nudity, as you can see, and she wants nothing more than to make you happy. We have her for the semester, but we’ll see how things go, and whether we want to keep her.“She’s completely invulnerable, so she can keep up with whatever you want to do to her. But, remember, she’s a human being. She’s not a slave, she’s not an inanimate object. You should treat her as a member of the house, not humiliate her, not intentionally torture her, and don’t do anything to her that she’s not comfortable with.”Suzy grabbed Holly’s profile off the table to read the restrictions. “So there are some things that she’s not supposed to do, here… Okay, she’s not supposed to be eaten, trapped in anyone’s shoe or sock, or anything involving urine or feces, or anything that is intentionally humiliating.”There were a few surprised murmurs, and Holly turned to look at the woman holding her and said, “It’s come up before.”Suzy looked somewhat shocked and amused as she repeated, “She says it’s come up before.”“But anal is okay.”“But anal is okay… Oh, wow.”There were a few ‘oohs’ and giggles from the crowd, and Suzy seemed a little uncomfortable, but she continued. “Uh, what else… Okay… She has to go back to X-Mart every Tuesday, so one of us will have to take her there. If she misses two weeks in a row, we’ll get fined, so make sure you do it.”Holly was still smiling, but nearly lost her balance again when Suzy lowered her back down and let her jump out of her hand onto the table. Suzy leaned up against the table as she continued, and Holly eyed her ass, half-seated on the table and wrapped in hip-hugging jeans. It wasn’t the first time she had served women so uncomfortable talking about sex, but chances were that she’d be in those pants soon. At least it was a nice ass.“So we have some controls for her,” Suzy picked up the remote that Holly had been delivered with. It didn’t have many controls, but it was about the size of a laptop. “We can control her size…” Suzy grabbed the slider and dragged it down to a minimum, and Holly shrank down to a minuscule size in a second. Overhead, the giantess' voice boomed like a goddess speaking from the heavens. “She goes down to one thirty-second of an inch…” She dragged the slider all the way to the top, and Holly rocketed up to a hundred times the size. She was tall enough now that her head almost met Suzy’s shoulders. She wasn’t used in this height often, but she could almost live a normal life like this. “And up to two feet.” Suzy left her in this size, comparing her remote to the page of instructions. “The green button that says ‘freeze’ makes her completely immobile…”Suzy pushed the button, and suddenly Holly was completely unable to move. She could stare all she wanted, but her muscles were locked in place. All she could do was turn her eyes and breathe. Not that she particularly needed to; it was another one of the benefits of the process. “But you can control her limbs, move her any way you want,” Suzy said. She grabbed Holly’s body in one hand to hold her steady and lifted her arms over her head with the other. The amount of force she had to use to move her locked limbs would have broken her arms in a dozen places if she had been this size normally, but she didn’t feel a shred of pain.Frozen solid with her arms raised over her head, she watched Suzy as she turned back to the remote and said, “The other button, the blue one that says ‘loose,’ makes her completely limp.”She pressed it, and Holly collapsed like a doll with its strings cut. Her limbs a tangled mess, her head bent at an awkward angle. She could, again, only move her eyes and breathe. Suzy scooped her up by the waist and held her up for all to see. She hung helplessly from Suzy’s hand, arms and legs hanging loose, and, when Suzy flipped her over, she folded forward, staring upside-down at her legs that dangled uselessly off the other side of the woman’s palm.The exhibition would have been humiliating, but what shame could a sex toy have? If anything, she was a bit excited, enjoying the somewhat careless way that the giantess handled her. A certain wetness started to develop between her legs as she considered all the things the woman could do to her in this vulnerable state.Unfortunately, Suzy didn’t decide to just start having her way with Holly in front of all her sorority sisters. She delicately placed her back down on the table, then hit the ‘cancel’ button. “The red ‘cancel’ button,” she explained, “Frees her from both of the other states.” Holly climbed to her feet and waved at the crowd again, beaming. “But the instructions say, ‘We think you should leave your toy free to move as they like. Our toys love their jobs and know how to make you happy. Tell them what you want and they may surprise you.’”Holly was proud to say that it was true. She had only ever taken female clients, and she had gotten exceedingly good at figuring out what got them going. This many woman could be a challenge, but she was confident that she would be each of these women’s favorite toy in short order.“Uh, on the top,” she reminded Suzy, prodding her arm.Suzy flipped the remote up and saw the other button. “Oh, right. The grey button on the top cleans her off. Clothes, dirt, anything, it all disappears and she’ll be left clean and naked.”Suzy pushed the button, but there wasn’t really much to change. She was already naked, and she cleaned herself not long ago. Her skin felt a little cleaner when she did it, though, but the mild wetness between her legs persisted. That was the one place that the cleaning didn’t touch.“So, uh, that’s it, sisters. Keep her in your rooms when we have guests over. We don’t anyone trying to kidnap her,” Suzy added. “And remember to share.”\nHolly beamed proudly at the women assembled before her as they started to disperse, wondering to herself who would be the first to use her. There were twenty, maybe thirty girls in front of her, all young, beautiful, and curious. She had been in their shoes not long ago, but she hadn't had a living toy to help her explore her blossoming sexuality.\nIt was going to be a fun month.\n","As Holly suspected, it was a few hours before any of the sorority girls felt comfortable enough to use her. She spent the intervening time learning her way around the sorority house, taking advantage of her two-foot height that allowed her to make her way around much more easily. She was keenly aware of the stares of the sisters as they passed by her, but that was to be expected. Her bouncing breasts and naked ass would have been a thing to be ashamed of if she had been trying to be a normal person, but what use did a sex toy have for modesty? They would eventually get used to her making her way around stark naked. When she wasn’t serving one of them behind closed doors, of course.\nEventually, one of them, a tall redhead with fair skin and a narrow face, wearing shorts that exposed her long, skinny legs, came up to her and kneeled down to met her face-to-face. “Hey, Holly,” she asked, a bit timidly, “Do you mind if we… uh… You know…”\n“That’s what I’m here for,” Holly replied warmly. “Why don’t you go grab the remote so we can do this in private?”\nThe woman seemed a bit at a loss for words, but nodded and strode away to where they had left the remote. Holly tried to follow, but the woman’s strides were far larger. A few seconds after she disappeared around the corner, Holly shrunk immediately down to eight or nine inches. She wouldn’t be able to make it very fast now, so she stood to the side of the hallway and waited for the redhead to return.\nRemote in one hand, the woman reached down and grabbed Holly in her fist with the other. She raised her arms over her head just before being picked up so they wouldn’t be pinned to her sides. \n“So what’s your name?” Holly asked the girl as she started making her way upstairs.\n“Amber.”\n“Amber? Well, it’s nice to meet you,” Holly said. Amber was holding her at around chest level, and she had fairly sizable breasts tucked up under a clingy T-shirt. At this size, they were enormous, and it was difficult not to stare at how they bounced ever so slightly with each step. “Are you nervous?”\nAmber smirked. “A little,” she confessed.\n“Don’t worry about it, Amber. We’ll talk about it.”\n“Actually,” she said, as she swung open the door to her room. “I’d kinda prefer if we didn’t.”\nWell, then. Holly stayed silent as Amber shut and locked the door, setting her and the remote down on the bed. She watched as Amber stripped her pants and her panties, revealing a thin, pale abdomen, her hipbones just barely visible, and a small triangle of reddish-gold hair above her crotch, matching the shade on her head, but a good deal curlier.\nShe left her shirt on, though, and climbed over Holly onto the bed, sending her bouncing up and down as her weight hit the mattress. She dove under the covers, hit the ‘freeze’ button on the remote, and grabbed Holly’s motionless eight inch-tall body.\nAmber bent Holly’s limbs the way she wanted carefully. Extending and locking out her legs, straightening her back, and crossing her arms across her chest. Then she lifted the covers and put Holly under with her naked body.\nIt was already getting hot under the covers, and the heat increased as Amber brought Holly down to her crotch. She could smell the delicious, musky odor, and could see, despite the darkness, the swollen red lips and glistening wetness. Another one of her powers. She could see, even in absolute darkness, so she could see what she was doing to her clients.\nNo need for that here, though. All it did for her was allow her to watch the quick, almost mechanical way that Amber brought her down between her legs, resting her face on her crotch as she shifted her hand. Then, without a moment’s hesitation, Amber brought Holly’s head down to her vagina and plunged her in.\nThe walls of Amber’s vagina were tight, and coated in a milky white, salty lubricant. It filled what little space there was, and ran down Holly’s throat with every breath. She felt the hot, sticky substance filling her lungs, but there was no reason to panic; she could stay in here for days breathing the woman’s fluids.\nThe soft, slick walls were deeply textured, but Holly was big enough to stretch the walls, turning the texture into tight wrinkles that grabbed at her body. No time to get comfortable, though. Almost as soon as Holly was inside Amber’s vagina, the giantess started to plunge her in and out, using her as a dildo.\nHolly watched the tight walls slide up and down her body, felt her lubricant-exposed skin exposed to the relatively cold air up to the neck on every outstroke, and felt the muscled walls envelop her body all the way to her knees, where Amber’s fist gripped her tightly, on every instroke.\nAmber didn’t move ferociously fast, nor did she savor the motion. She was quick, repetitive, but efficient. Holly was a little disappointed; a rubber dildo could have done her job; but every girl liked something different. Maybe Amber would be more intimate with her in the future.\nThe giantess finished in about five minutes. Her legs closed up, her vagina clenching quick and powerfully around Holy’s body a few times as her whole body shivered. A shuddering gasp escaped her lips with every contraction, and the orgasm finished and she let out a shaky, pleasured sigh of relief, ripping Holly out from between her legs and placing her soaking wet, frozen body on the covers.\nHolly just watched as Amber lay on the bed, her chest rising up and down with her heavy, pleasured breaths. She didn’t particularly like being frozen, but it was better than spoiling that blissful state. Better the woman think of her as a sex toy, and ignore the fact that she was being watched by her toy.\nAfter a few minutes, Amber seemed to finally notice her, and rolled over and pressed the cancel button on the remote, allowing Holly to move again. She climbed to her feet as Amber tossed off the covers, rising out of bed and throwing her pants and underwear back on, sliding a pair of panties on over her still-wet vagina.\nAmber ignored Holly as the tiny woman climbed over the lumpy blankets to where she had left the remote. The giantess left her room, leaving the door open, as Holly struggled with the remote. The Clean button was probably the worst design, a rubber pushbutton that she couldn’t get any leverage against when shorter than full size. She had to press her entire body weight against it before she felt it click, and the slimy bodily fluids disappeared from her skin.\nShe pushed the slider all the way up, returning her height to the more practical two feet, and slid off Amber’s bed to explore the second floor of the sorority house, which was too difficult to reach tiny.\nShe made it no further than the hallway, though, before Suzy came up from behind her and kneeled down beside her. “Hey, Holly, I got half an hour before class. Do you mind?”\nHolly wondered how long it would be before the women stopped asking and started just grabbing her and running to her rooms. To be honest, she kind of preferred being treated like an inanimate object. Everyone coming up and asking her if she was okay doing her job was an awkward and inconvenient way for her to do things.\nShe acted friendly, though. Eventually, the women would open up, and it would happen faster if she was friendly and eager. “Not at all,” she replied, smiling up at the woman’s massive face. “Amber left the remote in her room.”\nSuzy stood up, walking into Amber’s room, and emerging a few seconds later with the remote. Standing over Holly, she shrank her down to six inches, maybe a little less. Then she scooped her up in her hand, holding her in a sheltered cup that she could stand up in, and started down the hallway to her room.\nHolly stood in Suzy’s palm, holding onto her fingers for balance as she made her way to her room. She waited until the door was shut before she looked up and asked the giantess, “What do you want to do?”\n“I don’t know… What do you think we should…” she trailed off.\n“I want to suck your clit,” Holly told her.\nA smile started to grow on Suzy’s face, and she said, “Okay.”\nShe set Holly down on her desk and quickly stripped off her shirt and undid her bra. Her breasts, now free, sagged slightly as she tossed the bra to the side. They hung a little lower than Holly’s, and had dark brown nipples in the center, with wide, bumpy areolae. They dangled freely as she unbuttoned her pants and leaned down to slide her pants and panties down to her ankles.\nShe stepped out of her clothes and crashed into her computer chair. She grabbed Holly in a fist and placed her on the chair between her legs. There were grooves in the chair where her legs went, and a lump in the middle that Holly could stand on. If Suzy slouched a bit, her whole pussy was presented to Holly, washing her in a hot and powerful fishy odor.\nShe was clean shaven, which came as a surprise, given her timidity. She clearly cared enough to keep herself presentable. Her dark, wrinkly brown labia were spread ever so slightly, revealing light pink, glistening wet flesh beneath. Holly could barely see the bell of her clitoris, right at head height.\nOn either side of her rested Suzy’s legs, massive columns of smooth and tan skin. With her legs in the chair, they flattened out to fill the grooves in the seat, but they were by no means fat. Her entire body was lean, muscular, but few women were built for definition. Her legs were perfectly smooth and firm to the tough. Her breasts bounced a bit and her legs jiggled briefly as she scooted up to present her pussy.\nShe had a stark tanline on her upper thighs met her hips, and pale triangles from her bikini over her breasts. Her crotch, due to the blood flow, as a little darker than the rest of what would have been covered by her panties; it was almost as if it were tanned.\nHolly walked carefully up to Suzy’s crotch and placed her hand on her labia, fully aware of the fact that the giantess was staring down at her. She took her other hand and slid it up between her labia, feeling her way up to the woman’s clitoris. Then she brought her whole body in, pushing herself between Suzy’s lips and embracing the soft, burning hot flesh underneath. The giantess' bodily fluids coated her skin immediately, and she rocked back and forth, working her way through the tight folds of the woman's labia to the pink, sensitive skin below. With hetr body below the shoulder trapped between the lips of Suzy's labia, Holly planted her mouth on the hooded bulb of her clitoris, and started to lick, suck, and squeeze it with both hands.\nShe started slow, watching the woman’s response as best she could while half-buried in flesh as she slowly picked up the pace. She heard the woman gasp quietly, and felt her pelvic muscles give a quick, involuntary squeeze, and she knew that she had found the right rhythm.\nShe kept going, trying to keep the speed constant, rocking herself back and forth between the woman’s labia, burrowing herself as close as she could to the wet, sensitive flesh underneath. Above her, Suzy’s gasps grew more frequent, and she found it harder and harder to keep still as the pleasure started to mount. Her back arced, her shoulders squirming as her hands rubbed up and down her thighs, squeezing white-knuckle tight in as her occasional, involuntary contractions caused a sudden and sharp release of pleasure.\nThere was no need for Holly to do anything complicated. Suzy was enjoying herself plenty. She only had to keep going for a few more minutes, the build-up of pleasure taking more and more control from the giantess, to the point that she started to kick and shake, but still had the presence of mind to keep her hips still so her toy could work.\nThen she came. Her clitoris retracted into its hood as her powerful pelvic muscles clamped her vagina shut. Suzy’s abs stood out through her stomach when her back arced, thrusting her breasts forced as her mouth opened in a silent scream, unable to breathe in or out with her entire body tightened. Her hands shot to her crotch, pushing Holly against her pussy with all her might, and her legs slapped shut around them, forcing the tiny toy even harder agains the soft, soaking wet flesh.\nFor a long moment, Holly was unable to move, completely enveloped in the heat, the softness, the wetness of Suzy’s vulva. Her head was pressed mercilessly against her clitoris, as it retracted into its hood, then reemerged to slap her in the face.\nThen the orgasm finally ended, and Suzy’s legs opened, her hands pulling away. She wasn’t nearly done, though. Without warning, she sat up straight and scooted forwards, bowling Holly over onto her back and riding straight over her with her pussy. The motion was so sudden that Holly let out a shout of surprise, but it was lost immediately to the tons and tons of flesh that weighed down on her.\nThen, with Holly securely pressed into the seat by the pitiless weight of her crotch, Suzy began to grind her hips up and down. All Holly could do was lay there as her vulva rubbed over her face over and over again. Holly’s face was pressed into her clitoris one second, and was staring into the folds of flesh that led to the dark maw of her vagina the next.\nThis was way hotter than servicing her the way she had. The loved the taste of the woman’s flesh, but being used like this made her incredibly horny. A thick layer of lubricant coated the flesh that squeezed down on her, soaking her from head to toe, leaving her nothing to breathe but bodily fluids, which she inhaled eagerly, savoring the sensation of them sliding down her throat and filling her lungs. The woman tasted sour and salty, secreting a thick, slimy fluid that refused to free itself from her mouth and throat no matter what she did. \nSuzy rubbed on her for a few minutes, picking up pace and pushing down harder as she approached orgasm. Then she finally came, and Holly got to watch her vagina squeeze tightly shut right over her face, squeezing out the lubricant that had filled the empty spaces. Suzy’s hands clenched the chair almost tight enough to rip the leather, and she let out a short scream of unimaginable pleasure.\nThen she just sat there for a second, straddling Holly’s helpless body and breathing heavy. Holly didn’t move; the recovery was the last thing she wanted to spoil, and it wasn’t long before Suzy seemed to remember her and stood up off the chair. \nShe kneeled down on the ground in front of the chair and met Holly at head height as the shrunken woman climbed to her feet out of a puddle of lubricant. Holly was thoroughly soaked, a long, thick strand of mucousy fluid refusing to disconnect from her hand to her hip. She didn’t bother trying to clean herself off, though. A sex toy should enjoy everything about being used, and, to be honest, she kinda did enjoy being coated so thickly in sex juices.\n“Sorry,” Suzy said, grabbing the remote off the desk. She hit the clean button, and everything vanished from Holly’s skin. The tail of fluids that Suzy had left behind on her chair remained, though. “I got carried away.”\n“I’m glad you did,” Holly smiled back. “It’s good to see you enjoying yourself.”\n“Are you sure? Are you okay?”\n“I’m a little tougher than you think,” Holly assured her. All of Suzy’s weight had barely even registered as pressure. One of the many benefits of the process. She was functionally invisible. “You feel like going again?”\n“No, I… uh… I should get going.” Suzy quickly threw her pants back on. But, as she fumbled with her bra, she seemed to remember Holly again. “Oh, right.” She grabbed the remote and slid Holly back up to two feet, letting her jump comfortably to the ground off the chair.\nHolly watched, slightly regretting how quickly Suzy had cleaned her off, as the giantess hastily dressed herself. Suzy pulled still-wet panties up to her waist, and Holly idly wondered what it would be like to be a part of the crotch of her underwear. She admired the massive woman as she pulled on a pair of hip-hugging jeans, and then Suzy disapeared without so much as a thank-you.\nThat was part of being a sex toy, she supposed. Women never failed to enjoy using her, but rare was the one who would thank her for her efforts. She was a professional, though; she would take the orgasm as thanks enough.\n","When Suzy left, Holy set back to exploring the sorority house. Only a few of the girls had their own rooms. The rest shared rooms with one, two, or even three others. By the middle of the day on a weekday, most of the house had left for class.\nExcept one, apparently, Holly shrank down to four inches without warning, the sudden transition causing her to trip and nearly fall flat on her face. When she recovered, she heard footsteps behind her, and turned to see one of the sisters. She was relatively short, probably five and a half feet tall, with straight brown hair cut to the shoulders. Her round face and bright, eager smile had brilliant green eyes to match.\nShe wore a tight shirt that showed off her flat belly and sizeable breasts. Below the waist, though, she wore a pair of white-and-pink striped panties and nothing else, exposing short, lean legs that jiggled just slightly with every step. Her skin was smooth and tan, at least where one would expect the sun to shine, and her thighs were just barely separated where they met the crotch of her panties.\nHolly looked up admiringly at her, waiting to see what she would do. She didn’t disappoint, either. Looking down at Holly like she was no more than a toy, she bent down and scooped her up in her right hand. The sudden motion was incredibly disorienting, the unexpected pressure of the giantess' grip knocking the wind right out of her. It was an effortless motion to her, but it turned Holly's world upside-down, and she immediately felt absolutely helpless in the massive woman's grasp.\nHolly was able to get her bearings just enough to watch as the woman pulled the waistband of her panties with her left hand, then brought Holly, trapped in the woman's fist, down to her crotch. Without a second’s delay or so much as a word of greeting, the woman dropped her feet-first into her underwear.\nHolly landed on the fabric immediately, her feet wedging in between her cleft. The woman was shaven completely clean, not a single hair between her legs, and, when she let her panties snap shut, the flesh that Holly was pressed up against, normally sandpapery from regrowing hair, was largely smooth and deliciously warm.\nTwo of the woman’s fingers dug into the waistband of her underwear and pressed down on either of Holly’s shoulders, forcing her down into the crotch of her panties. Holly’s body bent with the curve of her crotch, and her feet, already fallen between the woman’s brown lips, led her body between her labia. She felt the flesh, heat, and subtle wetness wrapping around the front of her body as she was pushed down. And, before she knew it, her face was pushed right up against the giantess’ clitoris, the rest of her body sinking deep into her vulva.\nThe heat was incredible, the fishy stench overwhelming. She opened her mouth and sucked in more flesh and fluid than air. Soft, slimy skin pressed up all around her, making it hard to move, and she had to fight the natural urge to panic. \nNow, that was the kind of treatment she was hoping for. She had never gotten it on her first day, though. This woman was either incredibly horny, or kinky beyond anything she could have hoped for.  The woman, a twenty year old named Becca, removed her hand from her panties, satisfied with her toy’s placement, and gave her a playful press on the head through the cotton over her crotch. She felt the tiny features of the woman’s face press into her clitoris, and shuddered a little. If these toys were as good as advertised, it wouldn’t be long before she lost control of herself for pleasure.\nShe continued over to her room and put on a nice, tight pair of jeans, making sure they rode up enough to keep pressure on the toy, before leaving for her class. She examined herself in the mirror from all angles, including bent over and sitting with her legs spread wide. There was no way to see the toy woman through her jeans, and she was so deep in between her labia that she was barely even visible through her panties. The little, living toy, who had already started to squirm around a little against her pussy, would be her little secret.\n This wasn't the first time Holly had found herself in a situation like this, but it still took forever for her to get used to. The heat and the pressure, the unbelievable stench of the woman's genitals completely overwhelmed her senses.\nShe knew, to some extent, that she was lying down, faceup, but every step the giantess took, every move she made moved her crotch around. Most women didn't even notice it, but to Holly, it was pure chaos. She sat down, stood up, wiggled her ass into a tight pair of pants, and every second of the ritual was a dizzying, nauseating blur of motion to the tiny woman.\nEventually, things calmed down enough that Holly was able to get her bearings and understand what was going on. After a while, she realized that the woman was simply walking, a pattern she recognized from years on the job. There was a subtle vibration, a deep thud, and the woman's crotch shifted suddenly, with a pause before the process repeated.\nHolly wasn’t really sure what the woman wanted. It had probably taken the better part of ten minutes for her to get her bearings, but nothing had happened to her yet. Besides the little tap on the back of her head, the giantess had largely left her alone. Did she want an orgasm, or did she want to just feel a tiny person squirming against her pussy for a little while? She lay there, squeezed by the woman’s labia for a few minutes, feeling her hips sway back and forth as she walked about, before she decided she should at least start off with the latter.\nCareful not to stimulate her sensitive clitoris too much, Holly started to squirm around, as if she was trying to escape from her fleshy prison. Twisting her legs, wiggling her feet and toes around in the opening to her vagina, rubbing her hands up and down the flesh underneath her labia. There was little response from the woman, but she noticed, as time went on, that she started to grow increasingly wet between the legs.\nShe was enjoying it, clearly, but there was no more obvious response than her arousal, despite the fact that she was going at it for almost a full hour. From time to time, she felt the motion of the woman walking around, and felt a bit of extra pressure whenever she sat down, the flesh pressing up around her.\nShe didn’t want to rush things with this woman, but she had been stuck in her panties for more than an hour now. Holly kept her body squirming around against the soaking-wet flesh, but raised her hands to start rubbing her clit. She started slow and soft, but the response, with all the buildup, was immediate.\n Becca was sitting in class when the toy started to stimulate her clitoris directly. After more than an hour enjoying her move around in her panties, she had gotten so worked up that a spike of pleasure jolted through her like a spike of electricity the moment the toy laid hands on her most sensitive organ. She jumped and let out an involuntary gasp, her eyes bulging. It attracted a few stares, and she tried to cover it up with a cough.\nOnly a few seconds later, though, she felt the pleasure building, and her pelvic muscles squeezing hard without her consent, causing another sharp bite of pleasure to take her over. She bent over at the waist, trying very hard to hold back a gasp or a yelp, until it subsided.\nWhen she recovered, she crossed her legs and squeezed down hard with her thighs, trying to discretely get the toy to stop. But she was too deep in there. Too many layers of cloth protected her, too much flesh surrounded her, sheltering her from anything she did. Even if she leaned forward and tried to put all her weight on her crotch, the little woman continued unabated.\nAnd she stood no chance of holding them back, either. She stood up to leave before things got out of hand, and a third spasm of pleasure caused her to shoot out of her seat like a rocket, her back stiff, legs flexing and fingers splayed out, eyes wide and biting hard on her lip to keep the gasp from escaping.\nWhen she regained control, she hurried out of the classroom as quickly as she could, making her way to the bathroom. No sooner did she make it in, slamming and locking the door shut behind her, did another shock of pleasure send her shuddering to the floor, her back to the door. She sat there, enjoying it for a second, before she started fumbling with her belt, trying to get her pants off before the orgasm hit.\nToo late. Just as she got the button undone, she felt the pleasure build beyond the point of no return, and she closed her eyes, her hands gripping her thighs white-knuckle tight, as wave after wave of ecstasy flowed through her body.\n Holly got the giantess to come relatively quickly, though it was clear she was resisting. She could feel the woman’s legs shift and cross behind her, felt her hips tilt as she put all of her weight on her crotch, trying as best she could to slow her down. But all it did was cause the hot, soaking-wet flesh around her to squeeze in tighter, and made her responses to Holly’s efforts that much more obvious.\nThe woman’s orgasm was signaled by her clitoris sliding in and out of its hood in a rhythmic fashion. In, out, in, out, pushing against Holly’s face then receding, in time with the pulsing contractions of her vagina. She felt the flesh tighten and push forward, squeezing up against her feet, then falling back, at the same time that her clitoris drew back.\nThe next thing came as a surprise. The woman’s fingers dug between her legs and scooped her out from her vulva, ripping her right out of her pants and holding her at head height.\nGod. Holly thought that being put into the woman's underwear had been disorienting, but this motion was so sudden that it should have killed her. Without warning, her naked, fluid-soaked body rocketed a thousand feet into the air, torn from the heat of the woman's crotch and into the cool air.\nAs best she could tell, she was in a bathroom, but all she could focus on was the giantess' face. Gooseflesh crawled up and down her skin at the sudden rush of cold air, and she was unable to keep the look of fear and surprise off her face as her view shifted almost instantly from the pink, wet flesh of the giantess' pussy to the massive features of her face.\nShe had a round, cherub-like face, high cheeks and a smooth chin. She wore a small amount of shadow under her bright, green eyes, and her hair was pulled back from her forehead. Her cheeks shone bright red and she was breathing heavy, her full pink lips parted slightly to reveal bright white teeth. That was the view that she couldn't tear her eyes from. It would be all too easy for this woman to open her mouth, place her on her tongue, and swallow her whole. Then she would be stuck on a day-long trip through the giantess' intestines.\n“What the hell are you doing?” she demanded, her face flushed with pleasure, but her voice half-angry.\nHolly shrugged in the woman’s fist, smothering her initial instict of terror and trying to act professional. “Helping.”\n“I’m in class!” the giantess exclaimed, though there was a mischievous smile on her face and a half-laugh in her voice.\n“I can’t tell from down there,” Holly replied. “Your pussy was just so delicious, I couldn’t help myself.”\n“You haven’t even begun to taste it yet,” she promised, her eyes growing hungry as she stared down Holly. “You can’t do that again.”\n“Is that a challenge?”\nThe smile grew broader, and the giantess said, “Maybe it is.”\nWith that, she pulled open her panties and shoved Holy in headfirst, sliding her face across her vulva, between the lips of her labia, until she was staring directly into the dark, fleshy hole of her vagina. The woman didn’t waste any time. She immediately pushed Holly, headfirst, directly into her vagina, sliding her in up to her waist on the first push, then putting her fingers against her feet and shoving her in as deep as she could.\n \n","Becca was able to get her fingers down to the second knuckle before she couldn’t push Holly any further in. She drew her fingers out, stroked her clit a few times, and plunged them back into her pussy for good measure. She felt the tiny woman’s feet when she did so, and, satisfied with her toy’s safe storage, she pulled her hand out and pulled up her pants again.\nHer fingers were coated in a thick layer of lubricant when she looked at them. She was wetter than she had realized. That poor woman would drown in there if she was able. Curious, and a little horny, she licked the clear, sticky fluid off her fingers. Salty, a little slimy, and definitely not a taste she enjoyed. She spat it out in the sink and washed her mouth out with some water, eying her face in the mirror to see if her orgasm had ruined any of her makeup.\nShe couldn't imagine what it was like for the tiny woman, literally swimming in that revolting stuff, but the thought of it gave her a wicked pleasure. Her lips curled up in a sultry smile and she gave Holly a little squeeze with her pelvic muscles. God, it was satisfying to know that her pussy was the little woman's entire world.\n \nHolly was small enough that she didn’t completely fill the giantess’ vagina. The woman pushed her in until Holly’s head pressed against her cervix, and there was still clearly enough room for her fingers to fit in. The textured walls pressed in tight on all sides, the space formed by the ridges completely filled with lubricant. Holly was covered from head to toe in the hot fluid, tasting it, breathing it. There was nowhere she could go to get fresh air; she was completely enveloped in the woman’s body.\nThe soft, fleshy walls that held her fast absorbed her every motion like quicksand. If she tried to gain leverage in any direction, the elastic walls just enveloped her arms and legs. Above her head, the mound of the woman’s cervix, with the tiny, dark, hole in the center, was the only hard surface, but it was risky to play with that. Most women were extremely sensitive up there, and too much stimulation could be excruciatingly painful.\nThere were women who enjoyed it, but some women’s cervix dilated and plunged down with orgasm, seeking to scoop up as much sperm as possible into the womb. Holly wasn’t small enough to get completely sucked up in there, but it would be very easy for it to clamp down on her head, and she would be unable to escape on her own.\nAfter she got her bearings, she wondered what she could do to make this woman come from here. Her challenge had been pretty damn clear, but she wasn't in the best spot. The most sensitive part of a woman's vagina was near the entrance, and she was buried headfirst up to the woman's cervix. Her feet might be in the right spot to stimulate the more sensitive areas, but kicking blindly might be anywhere from aggravating to painful for the giantess, whose name she honestly still didn't know.\nShe could try to turn herself upside-down, or work her way down, but the only thing she could really get leverage against was the woman's cervix. If stimulating it was really painful for her, then she'd be put out of the mood immediately, and Holly would spend the next hour struggling and massaging for no reason, just aggravating her mistress.\nSome women just enjoyed the feeling of dominance; typically middle-aged housewives, they got off on merely knowing that there was someone who was a slave to their body. This giantess definitely got an erotic thrill off that kind of control, but Holly got the impression that she wouldn't be satisfied without some sort of sexual release. But, from where she was, there were no easy ways to give it to her.\nShe looked up again at the smooth, glistening flesh of the woman's cervix. It wasn't ideal, but there was only one way to know what kind of woman she was dealing with. Holly lifted her hands over her head and pushed up on that firm lump, gently, hoping that she could at least push her way down to the more sensitive parts closer to the entrance of the woman’s vagina. Almost as soon as she put pressure on it, though, the woman’s pelvic muscles seized fiercely, and the walls of her vagina turned to steel and clamped down, hard.\nHer lungs were forced empty, and her arms and legs were twisted around by that much pressure. She was frozen solid for a second, then the muscles relaxed, and Holly was left surrounded by the throbbing walls of the giantess’ vagina, gasping lungfulls of bodily fluids in surprise.\nSo she was a woman who enjoyed a little bit of play on her cervix. She enjoyed it a lot, it seemed. She probably didn’t know that about herself, but an involuntary contraction of that strength probably corresponded to an eye-popping wave of pleasure. Odds were that she had barely even gotten her pants back on.\nThe challenge she had been given was far too easy. Holly had a job to do, though, so she started vigorously massaging the woman’s cervix, rubbing and prodding at it, moving as fast and forcefully as she could through the viscous liquid that surrounded her.\n \nBecca was still getting her belt back on when she felt a sudden and powerful pressure deep inside her, a sensation that was accompanied with a pleasure so strong that she let out an involuntary shout and bent over at the waist, her hands snapping to her crotch.\nWhat the hell was that? She stood there, gasping for air and staring at her own feet as the pleasure slowly faded. How the hell was this toy so good? What was she doing to her?\nAnother wave of pleasure rocketed through her body. Her pussy clenched so hard around the toy that it hurt, and her entire body shook, a scream escaping from her lips that slowly turned into a shaking, laughing moan. She started to take off her pants and underwear, but they were only around her ankles when another pang of pleasure sent her hand back to her crotch, palms clapping against wet, hot flesh.\nShe shifted slowly, bare-assed, to the floor, unable to do more amidst the pure sexual ecstasy. By the time the next one came, she was on her back, pants and panties still tangled around her ankles, bare crotch exposed to the air, and a tiny woman inside her, giving her the sexual experience of a lifetime.\nShe screamed, writhing on the floor, hands clutching her naked buttcheeks like they were the only thing anchoring her to the world. By the time the pleasure faded, she felt herself already approaching the point of no return, the climax slowly building to an unstoppable level.\nShe let it happen. Her hips lifted, unbidden, off the floor as an explosion of pleasure rocked her entire body. Her legs shook, her back arced, and a sudden and powerful stream of clear fluid rocketed out of her crotch, spraying across the floor.\nShe had never seen that before. Every ounce of ejaculate that came from between her legs felt like an orgasm. She could barely breathe amidst the torrent of ecstasy, and, when the squirting finally stopped, the release was like nothing she had ever felt. She just lay there, thrusting her hips up and down, gasping and moaning desperately and incoherently. She had completely lost control.\n \nThe giantess’ pelvic muscles clamped down hard on Holly, so hard that she was completely unable to move. At the moment of climax, the fleshy prison that wrapped around her turned to steel and pressed in on all sides with bone-cracking pressure, and held there for an impressive amount of time.\nAt the same time that the walls squeezed shut, the woman’s cervix opened up and lowered into her vagina. Not far, but far enough to grab Holly’s hands, and the walls held so tight that she was unable to move her arms out of the way, and, when the woman’s vaginal walls relaxed, her cervix did as well, snapping shut around her wrists and forearms and pulling her a few inches upwards.\nThere was nothing she could do to escape now. She couldn’t get the leverage to pull her hands free, and she wasn’t strong enough to begin with. The hole in the woman’s cervix was extremely tight; it would have shattered her arms if she hadn’t been invincible. All she could do was lay there as the giantess’ pelvic muscles spasmed around her over and over, feeling the woman’s hips heaving in the throes of orgasm.\nBy the time she felt the giantess stand up and start walking around again, she had been subjected to over two minutes of the woman’s climax recovery, and another two minutes of just lying there, the walls of her vagina twitching around Holly and her rapid heartbeat booming all around her. After she started moving about, though, she didn’t dig into her vagina and fish Holly out like she had been expecting her to. For the time being, it looked like Holly would have to get comfortable.\nSo Holly didn’t bother stimulating the giantess any further. If it went at all like last time, she would only get herself further trapped inside the woman. If she got lost inside of the giantess’ womb, it would be a very long and uncomfortable time before she figured out how to recover her. It would be better to wait.\n \nBecca decided to leave the tiny toy in her vagina until she got back from class, secretly hoping that she would start up again and give her another orgasm like the last one. She wasn’t so lucky, though, so she decided to go back to her own place. The house wouldn’t notice if the toy was missing for an hour more, right? At least, they wouldn’t know who took it. \nAs she continued about her day, she found it almost impossible to ignore the tiny woman inside her, even though she never really moved. Maybe she had decided that one orgasm was enough for now, or maybe she had actually died. Fuck, Becca had come so hard that she wouldn't have been surprised if her pelvic muscles had crushed the toy like a bug.   In any case, Holly's body sitting inside her started to be an uncomfortable pressure in her pelvis. It came to the point where she started to get aggravated, feeling like the toy wasn't really earning her keep. She gave the tiny woman a squeeze or two, hoping to elicit a reaction, maybe get a little stimulation out of her, but she didn't budge. Her sore pelvic muscles complained at the exercize, so she let the tiny woman be.\nHer family was in town, including her nineteen-year-old sister Carina. She couldn’t afford to have the little woman giving her an orgasm in front of her family, but she couldn’t put her family off all day. So she got home, went into her bedroom, and took off her pants.\nShe tried to grab the shrunken woman while still standing, and, though she could get a grip on her legs, the sensation was far too intense for her to continue. So she collapsed, naked below the waist, onto her bed. She spread her thighs wide and slowly drew the tiny woman out of her body, shivering at the powerful spike of pleasure that came with it.\nBecca held Holly up to her face, the tiny woman soaked head to toe in a clear, slimy layer of her bodily fluids. It was remarkable how the tiny girl, scarcely five inches tall, had done so much to her. Becca would be more than happy to enjoy her efforts for a little while longer, but she had shit to do.\nShe cleaned the shrunken woman off, then pressed the ‘loose’ button on the remote. She told Holly that she would be back soon, then threw the little woman into her underwear drawer.\n","Holly was a little disappointed by how things went with the giantess. Not only did she not bring her back to the sorority house, but she had just been tossed into the woman’s underwear drawer like a plastic dildo, unable even to move. She lay there for a few minutes, then, without warning, light flooded the drawer as someone opened it up.\nHolly couldn’t even see what it was until a hand wrapped around her leg and pulled her out into the open. Before she knew it, she was hanging upside-down, staring at a young, brown-eyed, dark skinned girl with a long face and a short, scrawny body. Holly eyed the girl’s figure and realized with a shock that the girl couldn’t have been more than nineteen years old, maybe still in High School.\nThe girl recognized what she was, unfortunately. “Oh my God!” she exclaimed. “You’re one of those living toy things!” She looked around guiltily, then reached over and locked the door. “Where’s your remote?” she asked, digging around in the other woman’s underwear drawer. Unable to find it there, she picked up the woman’s pillow, and found the remote. “There it is.”\nShe lay Holly on the ground, still limp, and quickly stripped off all her clothes. Her face, smooth, round, and innocent, was the best indication of her age. Besides that, her breasts were fully developed, thin stubble of recently-shaved pubic hair growing between her legs. Tossing her clothes in the corner, she sat down, cross-legged with the remote in her lap in front of Holly. “So are you guys real? Can you talk?”\nHolly was unable to respond, so the girl frowned and looked down at the remote. She grabbed the slider and pushed it all the way to the top, and gasped when she looked up at Holly’s two-foot tall body. She was almost half the girl’s height now.\n“Wow,” she said, leaning forward and grabbing Holly’s leg. She stroked Holly’s skin, then grabbed her breasts. “You feel so real,” she remarked. She reached her hand behind Holly’s back and down to her ass, lifting her legs off the ground. Her other hand reached down to Holly’s crotch, and she slid her finger into Holly’s pussy. Even the teenage girl’s bony finger, at this size, filled her vagina in a very satisfying way. She would have gasped if she could have.\nThe girl drew her hand away quickly, inspecting the the wetness on her fingertip. “Ew,” she remarked, wiping Holly’s vaginal fluids on the carpet. “So this controls your size,” she said. She grabbed the slider again and shrunk Holly down a good bit, bringing her back down to three or four inches, then picked her up off the carpet.\nHolly couldn’t really see what was going on as the girl swung her about carelessly in her fist. Then she was tossed face-up into the crotch of a pair of underwear, staring up at the young girl’s skinny legs, stubby crotch, and gawky, adolescent figure. \nThe girl was looking down at her, her expression worried and hungry at the same time. \"I don't know if you can hear me, but you'll hang out there, okay?\" Holly had no response, so, with a shrug, the girl pulled her underwear up rapidly, and Holly was suddenly buried in the smooth, dark-colored flesh of the girl’s vulva.\nThat would never fail to be shocking. She was pressed up against hot flesh, elastic cotton at her back, and it had all happened in an instant. The woman's vulva was a tight, thin crack surrounded by dark, wrinkly flesh. The woman had pulled her underwear up so fast that Holly's entire left side was squeezed in between the soft, pliant lips, and she felt the slimy heat of the flesh beneath. It was a terrifying sensation; every instinct told her that she was being eaten and that she should fight for her life, but Holly suppressed those thoughts, forcing her body to stay still and breathe deeply. The air that filled her lungs was impossibly hot and moist, thick with the heady, musky smell of the girl's genitals. It was the perfectly suffocating counterpart to the pressure and heat that she felt, but Holly was able to force down her panic and analyze her situation like a professional.\nThere was a lot of moisture here, and the girl wouldn’t have put her in her pants if she didn’t think that she would enjoy it. Part of the training that she received was that, sometimes, younger girls would experiment with their sexuality. She had been told that she would be a gift to young, inexperienced women, or, in a less savory capacity, a training aid to aspiring 'barely legal' porn stars. In any case, the best thing she could do was help, and not make the girls feel ashamed just because of their age.\nIt was just a bit off-putting. Holly had been young once, too. She had experimented sexually, but offering a stranger such incomparably intimate access to the most sacred parts of her body had been a bridge too far until she was well into her twenties. This girl... This woman didn't seem to have a problem with it, though, and she was a goddamn professional. She would do her job, despite her squeamishness.\nShe tried to move, and discovered with surprise that she could. The girl must have unfrozen her while fiddling with the remote. She didn’t want to shock the girl by starting to work her to orgasm without warning, but why else would she put her here and unfreeze her?\nBest to start slow and see how she responded, Holly figured. She reached up with both hands and slid them between the slightly-wet, silky-smooth folds of her vulva, working around in the soft flesh underneath until she found the girl’s clitoris. The lips parted willingly at her touch, revealing vivid pink flesh underneath, appearing even brighter from the contrast with the darker color of her labia.\nShe wasn’t aggressive, just starting gently patting with her fingers. The girl’s response was immediate, though. She felt her entire body jump as she gasped, her vagina convulsed, shaking her entire vulva, and her hand shot to her crotch. Holly was shoved right into the soft flesh by the girl’s massive hand pressing against the fabric at her back, but she kept massaging.\nWithout warning, the girl dug into her panties and ripped her out. “What was that?” she demanded. She had gotten a shirt on, but her pants were still bunched up around her ankles. Holly didn’t respond, afraid that revealing herself would frighten the poor girl. The girl’s shocked look went away, and her left hand drifted down between her legs. Holly couldn’t see what she was doing from the angle, but her fingertips came back wet, and a smile started to creep across her face.\nShe dropped back to the ground and stripped her underwear, spreading her legs and revealing her smooth, pink vulva to the open air. The hand that held Holly was quivering with excitement and her breath was shaky as she laid Holly down between her legs and slowly slid her into her vagina.\nThe last thing Holly noticed before she disappeared inside the girl was that her hymen was gone. That could mean any number of things, but the most likely was that this girl had already experimented sexually. But the eagerness and guiltiness with which she played with Holly meant that her previous experiences had been lacking. No surprise; Holly had been in her shoes once, and she knew from experience that teenage boys were the worst creatures in the world. \nBut then her head passed between the lips of her labia and slid effortlessly into her body. The walls of the girl's vagina were incredibly tight, slick with moisture, rough in appearance but smooth on her skin. Holly could hear her rapid heartbeat through the walls. The girl’s shaky fingers pressed against her feet and pushed her all the way in, until her entire body was enveloped in hot, twitching flesh. Sized down to only about three inches in height, the girl’s vagina was a bit bigger than she was, so she was surrounded from head to toe by the tight, elastic walls.\nHolly knew what the girl wanted. She couldn’t help but hate herself for doing it, but she tried to remind herself that she was a professional. So she reached up and started to rub her arms and legs against the girl’s insides, squirming around against the muscles that wrapped around her from all sides.\nThe girl was sensitive. Only a few seconds in, her muscles contracted, snapping shut around Holly like the teeth of a bear trap, then relaxing immediately. She was surprisingly strong, and it was incredibly rapid. If Holly hasn’t been invincible, it surely would have killed her, or at least broken a few bones.\nBut she worked through it. It only took her a few minutes to bring the girl to orgasm, and, when she felt the powerful, long-lasting contractions of climax followed by the repetitive, weakening contractions of her recovery, she lay as still as she could while being buffeted on all sides by the young girl’s pelvic muscles.\nWhen it was all over, several minutes after Holly had stopped working, the girl dug Holly out of her vagina and hurriedly tossed her back into the other woman’s underwear drawer, throwing the remote on top of her and slamming the door shut.\nThe girl had definitely enjoyed it, but there was always that shame that followed when you were young and stupid. Holly, significantly smaller than the remote that lay on top of her, and every inch of her skin coated in the girl’s vaginal fluids, tried in vain to free herself for about thirty minutes before she was finally able to burrow into the underwear underneath her and dig herself clear.\nShe cleaned herself of and restored her size to around where Becca had left her, then pressed the “loose” button and collapsed back into the pile of underwear. She wanted to be discovered the same way she had been left; odds were that the little girl had been the woman’s sister, and Holly didn’t want her to be accosted for exploring her sexuality.\nOnly about ten minutes after she had left herself motionless in the dark underwear drawer, the drawer flew open, and the giantess’ face appeared, staring down at her. “Sorry to keep you waiting,” she said, grabbing the remote. She didn’t seem to notice that it hadn’t been in the drawer before. She picked up Holly in her other hand, and shrank her down to the minimum size. The woman’s hand instantly became a vast field of skin, with fingers that looked like distant mountains. “We’re gonna go meet my boyfriend,” said her booming voice.\nThen she picked Holly up between her thumb and forefinger and brought he down to her waist. She pulled open the waistband to her panties and pushed Holly deep into her vagina with her forefinger.\nThat motion may have been casual to the giantess, but it was terrifying to Holly. She sped towards the massive woman's crotch at incredible speed, then was suddenly surrounded by flesh, fresh air replaced by heat and an overbearing fishy odor. All sound was replaced by the deafening pounding of the woman's heartbeat, and all sight was replaced by the pink of the giantess' vaginal walls.\nAt this size, the woman's vagina was an endless cavern of bright pink, each ridge a mountain. A thin layer of moisture coated the walls; not the thick coating of lubricant that preceded sex, but it was still enough to keep Holly's tiny body clung to the walls even after the giantess’ finger pulled away. The walls were tight enough to touch each other, but the texture left small open spaces, and Holly had been left in one of these. It seemed, to her, like a small cave.\nAbout a minute later, Holly was free to move again. Not that it did her any good. She could hardly tear her arms and legs from the sticky wall, and, when she did, she just tumbled down to where the walls were squeezed tight together and stuck there, her limbs tangled in the flesh that surrounded her.\nWhat had the woman said? She was going to visit her boyfriend? If she had planned what Holly thought she did, then she might have to add another restriction to her contract for her next client.\n","Becca buttoned up her pants and released the toy’s movement. She couldn’t feel her moving around, so she gave her a little squeeze. No response. She must have made the little woman too small. Any bigger, though, and she would risk her boyfriend finding her too.\nShe drove over to his house and more or less rushed him straight into bed. It wasn’t hard. Her shirt was still on when he climbed, naked, on top of her, and her panties were still twisted around her left ankle. His right arm holding her left leg over his shoulder, he grabbed his cock with his left hand and slowly, carefully slid it into her.\nShe gasped as it entered her. She had spent so much time trying to feel the tiny movements of the shrunken woman inside her that the sudden bulk of his dick came as a huge surprise. She wrapped her arms around his back, willing him to go deeper, and he did, sliding himself into her as far as he could go.\n \nHolly felt the woman’s vaginal walls getting wetter, and her fears were realized when a massive penis, so large that the slit in the head was twice her height, came plowing through the walls that surrounded her, effortlessly pushing aside the elastic walls that had held her immobile.\nShe knew immediately that there was nothing she could do but ride it out, and hope that being this small would not leave her in the woman’s womb or trapped underneath the man’s cock. So she just lay there, silently regretting her career choice, as the head of the man’s dick slammed into her face and drove her deep into the woman’s vagina.\nWhen he pulled back out, the sticky residue of his cock held onto her until he was more than halfway out, where a fold of the woman’s vaginal flesh caught her and dragged her off. Then, next time, when it came back in, she was sucked underneath the head and dragged facefirst across the walls of the woman’s vagina, the rock hard body of the boyfriend’s cock pressing her mercilessly into the pink flesh.\nThe man pulled out again, and Holly was caught underneath the head, her faced shoved into the walls of the woman’s pussy until the man’s foreskin folded over her, enveloping her in a soft layer of wet, veiny flesh.\nFortunately, his foreskin was dragged back on the thrust back in, and Holly was yanked out, rolled between the body of his cock and the walls of the woman’s vagina like a mote of dirt between someone’s fingers.\nThe man picked up speed, and Holly was lost to the whirlwind of motion, unable to tell which way was up, whether she was inside the woman or not. One minute, she was being dragged in and out by the man’s dick, the next, she was being pressed pitilessly against the elastic walls as his dick just rode over her. \nThen she found herself faceup deep inside the woman’s vagina, staring backwards towards the entrance as the massive, pink head of the man’s dick came crashing back through the walls. He got as deep as he could just as his dick reached Holly, and the head bent down, his urethra spreading slightly by how much his cock was being stretched. It enveloped Holly’s head, and she was unable to escape as it snapped shut around her when he withdrew, grabbing her like a vice all the way down to her waist. She was yanked straight out of the woman’s vagina as the man pulled out.\nOn the next thrust, the head bent down in the same way. Except, instead of freeing her, her feet were pressed down agains the walls of the woman’s vagina, and the man’s urethra plunged down to swallow her entire body.\nThe pressure was unbelievable, the walls smooth and painfully hot, but she was spared the chaotic motion of the two fucking. She could still feel the back and forth movement of the man thrusting, but it was comparably pleasant.\nBut it only lasted a few minutes. She was already swimming in milky white precum; the man had to be close to finishing. But, even though he kept thrusting, and at the same speed, no less, Holly was stuck inside his dick for at least two more minutes before he climaxed.\nThe man’s cock flexed, and a torrent of fluid shot up from underneath Holly with incredible speed, shooting her from the tip of the man’s dick in a flood of thick, white ejaculate. She hit the walls three times, carried along with the stream of cum, until she finally came to a stop somewhere underneath the head of the man’s dick.\nHe pulled out as it started to soften, and Holly was dragged out underneath the head until his foreskin folded back over her, trapping her under his dick as he drew it all the way out and let it hang limp between his legs.\nThis was exactly what she wanted to avoid. She tried to struggle against the man’s flesh, but the thick, sticky fluid that was too viscous for her to move against, and the pressure of the man’s foreskin kept her from getting much leverage at all.\nIf she was lucky, the giantess would try and return her to size before the man left. Otherwise, she might find herself washed down a shower drain or trapped in a septic tank.\n Becca lay there, breathless, as her boyfriend rolled out of bed and started to put his underwear back on. She hadn’t felt the little woman inside her at all, but knowing that she was there had been enough for her. The thought of her being helpless between the thrusting, pulsing genitals of giant lovers made her horny even now. And the image of her living toy swimming in an ocean of lubricant and sperm almost made her start fingering herself.\nBut she had to figure out what had happened to the toy. They had been at it for about fifteen minutes, and she had kept the woman inside her the whole time, unable to feel her presence for more than an hour beforehand. Holly could be anywhere at this point.\nBecca rolled out of bed, reached into her purse, and grabbed her remote. She immobilized the woman and started to slowly slide her upwards. A second later, her boyfriend shouted “Fuck!” and struggled to rip his boxers off. The minute he did, a living, six-inch tall woman, naked and glistening from head to toe with bodily fluids, fell to the floor with his underwear. He jumped away like a giant spider had fallen out of his pants and exclaimed, “What the fuck is that!”\nBecca threw off the covers and snatched the girl off the floor. “Don’t worry about it,” she responded.\n“Is that one of those living toy things?” he asked. “Holy shit, babe, what did you do to her?”\n“Nothing! I just had her inside me while we were having sex.”\n“Holy shit.”\n“It’s her job, she likes it,” Becca told him, gesturing with the living woman in her hands.\n“And how expensive is that, anyway?”\n“The sorority paid for her,” Becca replied, looking down at Holly. The woman’s eyes were locked with hers, but she couldn’t move otherwise. “It’s just my turn to use her. I thought you’d like to try it out.”\nBecca’s boyfriend, fortunately, seemed interested. “Like how?” he asked.\n“Well,” Becca put the woman down on the bed, pressed the ‘clean’ button, and sized her up to two feet. “I want you to put her on your dick and fuck me with her.”\nHer boyfriend seemed unsure, but his dick was starting to get hard once he looked at Holly’s naked figure. Becca felt a sudden pang of jealousy, but quickly suppressed it. The little girl was a toy, not a person; the fact that she had a hot body was just part of what made her such a good one. She just resolved to be grateful that her boyfriend was able to come back so quickly. “You sure? She’s okay with this?”\n“She loves it,” Becca promised.\n“Why can’t she move?”\n“She’s… uh… she can’t. Not for another few hours. But she told me it’s fine.”\n“Alright,” he said. He grabbed Holly’s thighs, easily wrapping around them with his hands, and spread her legs, bringing her loose body towards him. He pressed the head of his cock against her crotch and carefully pulled her onto it, pushing deeper and deeper into her. Becca saw Holly’s chest rising and falling with greater speed, and could even see the bulge in her abdomen as her boyfriend’s penis, almost as wide around as her arm, slid into her.\n“She’s tight,” he grunted. “How the hell does that fit?”\n“Just wait,” Becca said, grabbing the remote. She shrunk the girl down to about six inches, moving the slider slowly and watching as Holly shrunk while mounted on her boyfriend’s dick. By the end, her torso was wrapped around his cock like a condom, the shape of it clearly visible through her skin, and it penetrated her all the way up to her chest.\n“Holy shit,” he said, wrapping his fist around the tiny woman and squeezing her playfully. “That’s unbelievable. Does it hurt her?”\n“Not at all,” Becca said. She walked slowly around him, watching the shrunken woman that was mounted on his dick, then pushed him onto the bed. “Enough talking,” she said, and climbed on top of him.\nHer boyfriend held his dick in one hand and her hip in the other, and pushed her down. She felt Holly’s head slide through her vulva as he got things into position, then he slowly slid her, and his cock, inside Becca.\nThe woman’s head was large; even after the pounding she had received earlier, it stretched her uncomfortably far. Fortunately, while on top, she could control the speed, and slowly slid up and down, enveloping the tiny toy in her vagina until she felt her head press against her cervix, and slowly slid her back out.\nBut her boyfriend was not content with this, and, in one violent motion, flipped her on her back, driving himself between her legs. With a firm grip on her thighs and her ass, he immediately started thrusting with all the force and speed he could muster.\nIn the midst of the overwhelming, unbelievably satisfying mix of pain and pleasure, Becca screamed.\n \n Holly couldn’t handle the pleasure. When she had been two feet tall, the sensation of the man’s dick inside her, stretching her vagina to three times its normal size, would have left her shaking and moaning in pleasure if she could have moved.\nBut now she was only a few inches taller than his dick. Her vagina had expanded to accommodate it, and it filled her body up to her chest. She was little more than his condom, and the normally dull, fleeting pleasure that came from vaginal penetration was now an electric ecstasy that completely blinded her.\nFor however long this lasted, she was only vaguely aware of what happened, lost in a cloud of sexual bliss. She wanted to scream, to squirm, to tighten every muscle in her body against the cock that filled her beyond the normal human limits, but she couldn’t move.\nShe just had to lay there, barely able to even breathe, her body a thin layer between the man’s cock and the woman’s vagina as the two fucked. She did not know how long it lasted, only that, when they finished, the man unleashed such a torrent of sperm into her insides that it came shooting out from between her legs.\nEventually, she was torn free, and left floating in a pool of bodily fluids inside the woman’s vagina. The pleasure had so robbed her of her senses that she wasn’t really able to process what was going on until she found herself shrunk down even further to a fraction of an inch, trapped in a thick layer of bodily fluids, on the walls of the giantess’s vagina.\nThey must have finished and shrunk her down to her minimum size. God only knew what they planned to do with her now, but she knew, as the tingling sensation of orgasmic pleasure slowly faded, leaving a feeling like pins and needles on her skin, that this giantess was going to get a stern talking to once she got back to X-Mart.\nThe last thing that she expected was for the couple to continue, so she was caught completely off guard when the man’s dick, every inch of its surface glistening with fluids, came crashing through the walls of the woman’s vagina and barreled right over her, grinding her mercilessly into the flesh of the giantess’ vagina.\nExhausted, she just lay there and let it happen. Thrown about inside the woman’s vagina like a piece of dirt. Sloshed around with the foamy mess of lubricant and semen, dragged against the walls of the giantess’ vagina by the relentless motion of the man’s cock. She was caught underneath the head of his penis, she was jammed underneath the flesh of the woman’s vulva, she was flung onto the opening of the woman’s cervix, then picked up again by the moistened tip of the man's dick for even more abuse.\nThe giant couple finished together, though it was likely the woman’s fourth or fifth orgasm. Holly was stuck to the fluid-soaked head of the man’s penis, her arms trapped in the slit of his urethra through some fluke in the chaotic whirlwind of motion that had come before. The man’s cock thrust deep into her, dragging Holly along with it, then exploded, issuing forth a torrent of sperm at incredible speed.\nHolly was thrown about inside the woman’s vagina, carried along with the flow, until she came to rest in a thin layer of fluid deep inside the woman’s vagina. She realized that she was right next to the woman’s cervical canal, and that her cervix was fully dilated, drawing Holly deeper with a sea of cum and lubricant, into her womb. Holly was helpless against the torrent of bodily fluids, falling into the woman’s uterus just as her cervical opening snapped shut behind her.\nHolly groaned, carried along with the flow of the fluids as it threw her against the walls of the giantess’ womb. The red, twitching walls were smooth, but covered in a layer of bodily fluids that had been sucked up from the residue from her sex. Nothing seemed to flow out; things only flowed in. It was going to be a very long time.\n","Becca sat beside Holly across the table from Holly’s boss. She didn't know what she had expected this man to look like, but he didn't look like either the sex toy-peddling creep that his job suggested, nor the stuffy suit that his expansive office and fancy desk implied. If anything, with his ragged beard, close-cropped hair, and Volcom polo, he looked like a business student only a year or so out of college. \nOne thing was for sure, though, he did not look pleased. Becca knew, the moment that she had realized that the shrunken woman had gotten stuck in her uterus, that she was going to be in a lot of trouble. And now the other shoe had dropped. \n“So I hope you understand that you violated the contract between your sorority and X-Mart,” the man told her. “Allowing your sister, an explicitly unauthorized user, to use her sexually, and the way that you used her while you and your boyfriend had sex is considered deliberate humiliation. Since your sorority has refused to pay for the month that Holly had to spend inside your body, and since you cannot afford to pay for the time, we have arranged for a means by which you can pay for the lost time through employment in our ‘Living Toy’ program at X-Mart.”\nBecca’s jaw dropped. “What? No way.”\n“Well, the only other option is for us to defer the debt to a collection agency. The other issue is the breach of contract by deliberately humiliating Holly, for which she would be well within her rights to press charges. If found guilty, damages could be upwards of ten million dollars.”\nBecca was speechless, but Holly’s boss continued. “Holly has agreed to drop the charges, however, should you agree to employment as a Living Toy. We have several clients lined up for one-month contracts that you could fill. Any obligation beyond that would be at your discretion, and you would be paid for the time.”\nBecca was having a hard time swallowing her pride, but it really was her only option. “Who are the clients?” she asked nervously.\n“Well…” he typed on his computer for a few moments. “Tri-Delt sorority is interested in a one-month, which would be under the same conditions that your sorority took. We have a gentleman named Derek, which would be an ‘anything goes’ contract. It’s day-by-day, but you would have to go the entire month, if he so desired.”\n“What if he doesn’t?” Becca asked.\n“Then you owe the extra time at a later date. Derek has requested monthly services, but our girls have refused his services since his first month.”\n“What happened?”\n“It’s a private matter. Nothing illegal, just… unsavory. The third is, well, Holly herself. A one-month, anything goes deal.”\n“You should take that one,” Holly said. Becca had been pointedly ignoring the girl sitting next to her, and couldn’t bring herself to make eye contact even when she spoke. It was too embarrassing to look at her and think about her being trapped in her womb until her period, which had come late that month of all months, dragged her out.\n“Honestly, Holly is right. She’s one of the best at what she does, and she can teach you should you consider continued employment.”\nBecca didn’t like any of that. To be used, day in and day out, as a living dildo by a hundred women? She knew some of the Tri-Delts. She couldn’t imagine being stuffed into their vagina like a dildo, and she couldn’t bear the thought of facing them once she was returned to normal. And then there was that Derek guy. God only knew what kind of perverted shit he got up to.\nBut what if Holly wanted revenge? Becca had used her basically without regard for the fact that she was a real person. Holly could do literally anything she wanted in reprisal. But, even with that, it was still better than being an entire sorority’s plaything for a month.\nWhat choice did she have? \"Fine,\" she said quietly, looking down at her own feet, \"I'll go with Holly.\"\n\"Great,\" he replied. \"Just drop by tomorrow morning, we'll have some paperwork for you to sign and shrink you so you can get started.\"\n \n \n\"So I guess you already know how the whole thing works,\" Holly told her. Becca sat, six inches tall, in her cupholder as Holly drove home. \"Nothing can hurt you, nothing really hurts at all, actually. No need for air, water, or food, though you proved that.\"\nHolly paused, looking down with an amused smile at the tiny woman struggling to keep her balance amidst the irregular motion of the car. Eventually, she fell onto her ass, with a tiny yelp that was more of a squeak. Holly had to suppress a laugh and looked back up out the window. \n\"It's actually kind of fun,\" she continued. \"It can be dangerous, sure, because you can find yourself in situations you can't escape from, but it can be fun.\"\nHolly grabbed the remote from the passenger seat and hit the 'clear' button. Becca had worn her clothes to the shrinking, despite the advice to just come naked. As soon as Holly hit the button, her clothes completely disappeared, and she immediately tried to cover her breasts and crotch, letting out a frightened shriek.\n\"You're just going to have to embrace it,\" Holly said. \"Forget about modesty. You're going to be intimate with people in a way that their husbands or boyfriends could never be. There's no point trying to keep them from seeing you naked.\"\nBecca didn't seem persuaded, curling up in side of the cupholder in a pathetic effort to keep herself covered up. Holly had to keep herself from rolling her eyes. \"Look, you etiher get comfortable naked, or I freeze you and tie you to the grill for the rest of the drive.\"\nBecca was still unwilling, but decided to uncover herself, slowly drawing herself to her feet and presenting her naked body to Holly. She still looked uncomfortable, constantly glancing down at her own body. The 'clear' function had wiped away her pubic hair as well, and, to be honest, she was an attractive young woman. Her short build meant that her breasts and hips would be even more pronounced if she were raised to dildo size. Holly felt a little stirring between her legs just thinking about it.\nStopped at a light, she admired the tiny woman for a few moments before she started moving again. \"See? You're a sexy girl. You've got a lot to be proud of.\"\nThat seemed to encourage her a little bit, and she stood up straighter, at least until Holly hit the gas again and she stumbled over. \"In case you were wondering,\" she said, \"Derek had a friend of mine for a month. For that entire one month, he would shrink her all the way down, stick her into his dick, masturbate into his own mouth, swallow her, and size her up and force her to pass through his intestines at about five inches. Then he would shit her out and do it all over again.\" Holly spoke casually and flatly to freak the little woman out, but, honestly, the concept gave her the creeps as well. She had been eaten once or twice before, and it was one of the worst experiences of her life. She couldn't bear to imagine a month of it, continuously. \"He's been on the waiting list for almost two years since then, even though we made it so that you have to reapply every month to stay on.\"\nThe car was silent for a minute, then Holly said, \"Honestly, I thought about taking the Tri-Delt job, and leaving you with him, but I didn't think that anything was going to come out of making you miserable. You and I, we're going to have a lot of fun together. In fact,\" she started to unbutton her shorts. \"Why don't we start now?\"\nShe grabbed Becca out of the cupholder with her right hand and pulled open her panties with her left. One eye on the road and the other on Becca, her knees holding the steering wheel, she pushed the tiny woman down, headfirst, into the crotch of her underwear, shoving her face against the already moist, smooth flesh of her vulva. As soon as she was satisfied with the girl's position, she let her panties snap shut and put both hands back on the steering wheel.\n\"Just do your best down there,\" she shouted; she knew from experience that, once the pants were buttoned up, it could be hard to hear what was going on. \"I want to see what you can do.\"\nThe tiny woman was reluctant at first, probably disgusted. Holly felt her squirming, but it wasn't even remotely pleasurable, only the sloppy scrambling of someone trying to escape. Holly gave her a minute before giving her an encouraging tap through the crotch of her shorts. \"Don't be afraid of it,\" she said. \"We've all got one, you should know your way around. Show a little love!\"\nStill nothing. If anything, the tiny woman seemed to settle down. Eventually, Holly reached her right hand down her pants and pressed her middle two fingers against Becca's back, dragging her up and down across the flesh of her vulva a few times before sliding the woman headfirst an inch or so into her vagina. She held her there, buried up to her shoulders inside Holly's pussy, and gave her a playful little squeeze before pulling her back out.\nTo her, it must have felt like she was about to die. Holly remembered her first time inside a woman's vagina. The heat, the smell, and the flood of moisture had been suffocating. Feeling those muscled walls closing around her had sent her into a claustrophobic panic.\nAnd, sure enough, Becca started to flail around, struggling wildly against her two fingers. It was awkward, amateurish, and really not all that pleasurable. It might have been barely worth her time if she had been in the right mood, but, now, it was barely enough to distract her from the road. Holly pulled Becca back out and left her resting right in the center of her panties. But, the moment she did, the shrunken woman stopped struggling.\n\"Hey!\" she called, \"Don't stop, that felt kinda good!\"\nNo response again. Holly licked the salty fluids off her fingers, then gave Becca a little tap through the fabric of her shorts again. Eventually, Becca reluctantly started to massage and squirm aginst Holly's vulva. It felt alright; there was a lot of sensitive flesh down there, but it wasn't anything to write home about. Her feet brushed against Holly's clitoris a few times, but she never bothered trying ay penetration. She was at a bit of a disadvantage from how Holly had placed her, but she could have done a lot of she hadn't been afraid to push her hands into Holly's vagina.\nHolly let her go for the rest of the ride home, thinking more about ways that she could help improve the woman's abilitities than actually enjoying her efforts. When she swung her legs out of the car and started walking into the house, Becca stalled, apparently assuming that she was done, but Holly gave her a gentle reminder to continue with a tap on her crotch.\nShe hadn't been home in a month, so she had to go around making sure that all her things were in order. Her roomate, Paige, kept the place neat and tidy while she was on long jobs, but she worked in the same program with XMart as Holly did. Sometimes, if they didn't time their jobs right, their house could go unattended for months at a time.\nShe made her way around the house, making sure that everything was in order. Everything should have been exactly as she left it, and she had no reason to believe otherwise, but it was hard not to get paranoid when you had been more than a month away from home. Also, she got a bit of a thrill out of exposing Becca to a giantess' routine; every time she bent over or crouched down, her shorts hugged tight agsinst her ass and rode up into her crotch, and she could feel Becca being pushed harder into her vulva. It didn't make her efforts any more effective, though. \nPaige wasn't home, and everything seemed to be in order. So Holly made her way to her room and casually stripped her pants and tossed them into the corner. With a sigh, she collapsed into her chair in front of the computer. She dug the tiny woman out of her underwear, then slid them off, sitting her naked ass on the cold leather chair.\nHolly pressed the 'clean' button on the girl's remote and set her between her legs. \"So, you showed me that you know your own body, but things are a little different when you're down there, aren't they? And every woman is a little different, too. You need to figure out how to play around, gague their responses, and react accordingly. Did you notice anything in the last half hour that may have seemed like an orgasm?\"\nHolly didn't bother trying to listen to the little girl's response. \"You didn't,\" she said. \"Because there wasn't one. You got me good and wet and that's it. You'd probably make a good dildo right now, but I'm gonna give you another chance.\"\nShe put a single finger against Becca's back and slowly pushed the tiny woman towards her crotch. \"Don't be afraid to get in there. It may seem claustrophobic at first, but you don't need to breathe, and nothing I can do can hurt you. You have free reign over my body.\"\nBecca took a step back from where Holly had pushed her, her face showing clear revulsion at what was surely an overwhelming assault of smell and sight. Holly remembered her first time, too, but this girl had to learn her place eventually. \"I have free reign over your body, too,\" she reminded her. \"If you don't do what I want, we're going to test exactly how invincible you are, understand?\"\nThat threat did it. The tiny toy, with no small amount of hesitation, approached her crotch and started to tentatively massage the outside of Holly's labia. If anything, it was even more boring than before. \"Focus on the clit,\" she said, rubbering her middle finger over it to show her. \"And watch what happens there when you do.\"\nHolly watched as Becca started nervously rubbing her clit, but it really wasn't doing much for her. Performance anxiety, probably. She put a pair of headphones in and pulled up some porn. She might as well judge her toy's results, not her stage skills.\nAfter a little while, it started to work for her. Her hips began to rock, unbidden, as the pleasure started to spread through her body, and her left hand wandered up to her breast and started to grope. \"Harder,\" she gasped, trying not to bowl the little woman over with her hips.\nShe clicked through her video lustily, watching a woman writhe on a bench, screaming through a gag and straining against her binds as she was forced into orgasm over and over again. The pleasure of the little woman working between her legs spread through her body, and she had to fight against the temptation to bring her hand down and finish the job herself. \nShe finally came about fifteen minutes later, her entire body seizing up and a pleasured shout escaping her lips. Her thighs clapped together around the tiny woman, and her hands gripped the chair white-knuckle tight as a wave of pleasure shot from her head to her toes.\nThen the climax passed, and she slumped back in her chair, spreading her legs and looking down to find the little woman on her back. She giggled, reaching up only briefly to pause the porn. \"Sorry about that, but that's something you'll have to get used to. Some women can't really control themselves at the peak. But it didn't hurt, did it? Bet it was a surpise, though...\"\nShe breathed a shaky sigh and ran one hand through her hair. \"That was good,\" she said. \"You did good. You saw how the vagina responds to stimulation like that, you hear and felt how I responded. That's the kind of cueing you look for. Find the spot and the pressure and the speed and keep at it until the job's done. Clitoral orgasm is a guaranteed for any woman, but there are other ways.\"\nHolly put her hand against Becca's back and pushed her unceremoniously into her vagina. Feetfirst, sliding her up to the waist. \"Just hang out in there for now. See if you can't find one of the other ways.\"\nWith that, Holly placed a finger on her head and pushed her in, until she felt the woman's feet bottom out. She turned the porn back on and started masturbating again.\n","All Becca could think, as her legs were shoved into the giantess' vagina, unable to fight agains the monstrous strength of the woman's hand, was how this woman had been once been no more than a toy to her. Less than three days ago, really. And now her vagina, longer than she was tall, hungrily absorbed her up to her waist.\n\"Just hang out in there for now. See if you can't find one of the other ways,\" Holly told her. Her tone of voice was casual, almost bored, but the size of it was booming. Becca could feel it in her bones. The woman put a single finger on Becca's head and shoved her bodily into her vagina.\nShe had already experienced what felt like a lifetime of torture under this woman's pussy, but it had only been thirty fucking minutes. And it wasn't any better now. She had been able to suppress her revulsion long enough to bring the giantess to orgasm once, hoping that it would earn her a reprieve, but things just got worse and she didn't even have the energy to fight anymore.\nThe smell had been offensive, the heat oppressive when she had been between Holly's legs. But, in that moment before Holly pushed her all the way in, she could feel that it was about to get so much worse. Her legs all the way to her waist, and even her forearms stuck to her sides, were smothered completely in slimy heat. Her first instinct was to pull her hands out and try to worm her way to freedom, but she didn't even get the time to move before she was shoved all the way in.\nIt was like she had been transported to a world of infinte heat and flesh. The walls that surrounded her grabbed her tight, squeezing against every curve of her body like a latex glove. The flesh was heavily textured, glistening with a thick layer of slimy lubricant. It filled every space, clinging to her no matter what she did to escape it. She tried to get a breath of fresh air, but the thick fluid filled her mouth and slid down her throat with every breath, frothing as it mixed with air that was so heavy with the musky scent of the giantess' sex that it felt like fluid itself.\nIt didn't choke her, though. She didn't even feel the need to cough as she felt the fluid filling her lungs. In a way, it calmed her suffocating panic, but the heady, savory taste was nauseating, and the feel of it clinging to her throat, the heat filling her lungs, was terrifying in its own way.\nIt made no sense that she could see at all in here, but she could, staring at pink flesh that pressed up against her face and at the frothy lubricant that filled its textured gaps. She felt hemmed in and violated at the same time, resenting every hot, fluid-filled breath. She thought it had been bad in Holly's panties, she thought it had been bad when she was forced to massage the woman's genitals to orgasm, but this was something else. The distant, bassy drum of her heartbeat, the walls quivering with every pulse, the hot, sticky feeling of the woman's cervix under her feet. It was overwhelming, absolutely disgusting, and it had scarcely been a minute. How was she supposed to endure a month of this?\nThen, unbelievably, the giantess started to masturbate. She could feel it from the way that the walls of her vagina started to jerk around, her fingers bending and stretching the pliable flesh of her genitals as she massaged her clitoris.\nShe was rough, and she was quick. Becca was twisted around with the giantess' vagina as she rubbed a circular pattern over her clit, and, in a few minutes, Becca felt herself moving back and forth as Holly began to rock on her hips.\nBecca was a helpless prisoner to all this; she may as well not have been involved at all. She couldn't even move under the pressure of the muscular walls that enveloped her helpless body. All she could do was endure the ride as the giantess massaged her clit.\nThen, without warning, she came, and her vaginal muscles clenched down hard. Becca had masturbated before, she knew what happened when she reached orgasm, but she never could have imagined living it like this. Her world was already a ceaseless hell of heat, flesh, and pressure. But, when the giantess climaxed, the elastic flesh that surrounded her turned to steel and clamped down hard. Becca was frozen in place by the pressure, and all she could hear was her own heartbeat pounding in her ears.\nThen, finally, Holly's pelvic muscles relaxed, and Becca was afforded one brief, fluid-filled breath before they squeezed again, powerful muscles pushing the breath out of her. The contractions came one after the other, squeezing her helpless body like a muscular trash compactor. When the giantess' pelvic muscles let up, she couldn't help but gulp down a lungful of the slimy fluid, at least until another contraction slammed down and drove it out of her again.\nThe giantess' orgasm only lasted fifteen seconds, but it felt like an eternity from Becca's position. Eventually, the giantess relaxed, and Becca laid there, surrounded by flesh and heat, swimming in fluids that were now a little more opaque than before. \nNow what? As far as she could tell, Holly was still seated in her computer chair, gasping deep breaths as she recovered from her orgasm. But what was next? Would she fish Holly out? Would she start masturbating again? Or would there be something worse? But, for the next few minutes... Hours... Days? Nothing happened. Becca felt Holly moving around, heard the rapid pounding of her heartbeat settle into a more smoothing rhythm, but, beyond that, nothing happened. Nothing that served to distract her from the ceaseless heat and pressure of the giantess' vagina, anyway.\nGod, it was awful. There was no way to describe it. The heat was incredible, though it was impossible to tell how much sweat had eked from her skin when every inch of her body was coated in vaginal fluid. The blood was pooling in her head, but she could barely even move her limbs against the fleshy pressure around her; she stood no chance of righting herself.\nBecca could kind of tell when the giantess went from standing to sitting from the way the pressure shifted around her. When she walked, the unmistakeable swaying of her hips rocked her back and forth. Then she heard, or felt, the vibrations of her speaking. Who was she talking to? Was there someone else out there?\nWhat was she supposed to do here? \"See if you can find one of the other ways,\" she had said. Was she supposed to make the woman come from in here? Holly had been able to do it to her, but Becca had no idea how. Maybe, if she hunted hard enough, she could find the girl's g-spot.\nShe tried to pull her arms from her sides, probing the soft flesh around her. God, it was like trying to move in quicksand. Hot, fluid-soaked quicksand. In short order, she was panting from exertion, heedless of the fact that she was sucking fluid down her throat instead of air. She felt like she was getting close, though. Right around where her own was, right? A few inches in, about at her waist level.\nHolly put a stop to it immediately with a powerful contraction. It was so sudden and so strong that Becca let out a gurgling scream, half in surprise, half in pain. When it passed, she stopped trying. Apparently, Holly didn't want it even though she said she did.\nBecca felt her speaking again, then the walls around her seized and bucked as she heard the giantess laughing. God, this was awful. The giantess was torturing her on purpose at this point. A whole month of this? It had hardly been a day. Maybe she should have just paid the penalty. \nSuddenly, she felt the walls shifting, and there were two fingers in there with her. They reached in, effortlessly pushing the walls apart, and pressed down hard on her chest. Then she was dragged out. In an instant, her world of flesh disappeared, and she got a flash of Holly's shaven pubic area, the damp gusset of her panties, the entire length of her body, then she was hanging in midair, held up by a finger on either side of her head.\nBut it wasn't Holly she was looking at. It was another girl. A skinny black girl, with short, wavy hair. She was taller than Holly, with a skinnier face as well. Her brown eyes regarded Becca with an eager, almost hungry look. She wore short shorts and a clingy T-shirt, showing off perky breasts, a tight waist, and long, athletic legs. Her skin was very dark, and her teeth seemed almost brilliantly white as her lips parted in a smile.\n\"Hello there, little girl,\" she said. \"Holly has told me all about you. We are going to have so much fun together.\"\n \n Paige worked the same kind of job as Holly. She had worked it for two years longer, and was the one who had recruited and trained Holly to begin with. Her last job had been with an unimaginative couple that she had worked with for a week and a half to rekindle their sex life. By the end of it, they were into some pretty freaky shit, very little of it size-assisted, but Paige had had a lot of fun with them anyway.\nAfter her traditional first-day-big lunch at Chipotle, she went home to find that Holly had returned from her job as well. She had heard that her job had gone south and ran long, but her boss hadn't explained more than that. So she was interested to ask what had happened.\nShe opened the door to see Holly watching TV in her panties and a pajama shirt, curled up on the couch with a bag of pretzels. She greeted Paige with a smile,\n\"Hey, girl! Welcome back!\"\n\"You too,\" Paige replied. \"How'd it go?\"\n\"Not that well,\" Holly told her. \"This girl had her boyfriend fuck her with me in there and I got stuck in her womb for the rest of the month.\"\n\"When was this?\"\n\"Like, the first day,\" she answered.\nPaige grimaced. Nothing really gained from a job like that. \"That sucks. So what happened?\"\n\"Well, the store covered my lost pay, but the girl couldn't pay up for the damages. So we offered her to pay on the job.\"\n\"No way. Where is she now?\"\nA pretzel in her hand, Holly raised her eyebrows and smiled, shifting her legs a little. Paige burst out laughing. \"Oh my God, you bitch! For how long?\"\n\"A month,\" she said, her sultry grin not moving an inch.\n\"That's awesome,\" Paige said, sitting down on the couch beside her and grabbing a pretzel out of the bag. \"Can I share?\"\nHolly shrugged. \"It's anything-goes.\"\n\"Does she hate it?\"\n\"Probably,\" replied Holly. \"I haven't really done anything with her yet.\"\n\"Give her to me, I'll make her hate it.\"\nHolly took a deep breath through her nose and shifted her legs again, thinking about it. \"Boss said she might work for us when we're done.\"\n\"It's nothing she wouldn't see on the job,\" Paige promised. \n\"Hmmm...\" Holly thought for a moment, then her grin broke into a full smile. \"Okay!\" she said, jumping off the couch to grab the remote aross the room. She moved to hand it to Paige, but held back, her eyes narrowing. \"But I get to play with her too, okay?\"\n\"Just say when.\"\n\"And not the horse thing, either.\"\nDamn. \"Not the horse thing.\"\n\"Seriously, that's just...\" Holly paused, her eyes rolling up. Her grip tightened around the remote a bit. \"Mmm. I think she found the spot.\"\n\"Already?\"\n\"She's no good at it. She knew her own body well but she's helpless down there.\" She looked down at her own crotch. \"Stay quiet down there!\" she yelled.\n\"Punishing her for trying? That's hot.\"\nHolly laughed. \"The bitch deserves it. Just not the horse thing, okay?\"\n\"Promise.\"\n\"Okay,\" Holly handed Paige the remote and licked the salt off her fingers. Then she dug into her underwear, looking thoughtful for a moment, and produced the tiny girl, holding her up for Paige to see.\nShe was a cute one, even looking like a soaked rat, her skin flush with the heat. It took her a moment to process was was going on, and she finally seemed to notice Paige, her expression shifting quickly to fear. The look on her face put a smile on Paige's; oh, the innocent ones were always the best.\n\"Hello there, little girl,\" she said. \"Holly has told me all about you. We are going to have so much fun together.\"\nShe didn't even give the girl the chance to react, she just wrapped her mouth around her and sucked her right off of Holly's fingers, playing with the taste of Holly's pussy that coated the tiny woman.\n\"Oh my God!\" Holly exclaimed with a giggle.\nPaige grinned in response. She could feel the tiny girl struggling, it even seemed like she was screaming, so she pushed her hard against her palate. That put a stop to that. Holly looked almost disappointed, \"No, don't just eat her,\" she said.\nPaige held up a finger, playing with the little girl in her mouth. She bit down on her playfully, shoving her up into her cheeks and tucking her up underneath her tongue. Then, stifling a giggle at the tiny woman's helpless, flailing limbs, she moved her to the back of her throat and swallowed her with a single gulp.\n\"I'll bring her back up,\" Paige replied now that her mouth was clear. \"Just giving her the crash course.\"\nPaige sized her up a few inches, feeling her stomach grow fuller as she did so. She wasn't likely to pass through at that size, but it didn't hurt to be safe, and that would be days wasted with her toy traveling through her intestines.\n\"I think she's fighting,\" Paige said, giving her belly a loving tap. \"Keep it up, girl! You've got a long month ahead of you.\"\n","Fighting against the giant woman's tongue was helpless. It was one giant muscle that was bigger than she was; it would have her way with her, slathering her with spit in the process. But that fact, even the knowledge that she was completely invincible did nothing to stop the surge of fear that siezed her when the woman opened her mouth underneath her.\nThe woman closed her lips around Holly's fingers and sucked her off, and Becca fought with every ounce of her strength, mindless in the face of the primal urge to escape before she could be eaten alive. She may as well have been trying to wrestle a T. Rex. The girl's tongue did exactly what it wanted to her, and it didn't even have to try. Becca didn't even realize she was screaming until the tongue surged up and pressed her against the roof of the girl's mouth, squeezing all the air out of her lungs.\nThe giantess played with her for a few seconds, but it seemed like eternity. Her breath quick, her heart beating furiously, Becca fought ceaselessly and futilely to escape, one eye always on the dark pit of the woman's throat behind her.\nEventually, the woman's head tilted up, and Becca slid helplessly to the back of her throat. She didn't even have time to scramble for a handhold. A single, exhausted \"No\" escaped her lips, and the woman's throat clamped down on her legs and dragged her into her stomach.\nThe trip down her fleshy, muscular esophagos was quick, so quick that she couldn't process the suffocating pressure of the massive woman's throat muscles. Beore she knew it, she was in the pit of the giantess' stomach. \nHer panic settled into a more manageable dread, but there was still no fighting the woman. Her stomach writhed and squirmed like a living thing, defying her efforts to get to her feet and making sure that she was quickly coated in clear slime. She knew that it was acid and she should be dissolving right about now, but the most she could feel was a subtle tingle on her skin.\nThen, without warning, her surroundings seemed to shrink. It took her a second to process that her size had been changed, but, by that time, the giantess' stomach was uncomfortably small. The pool of half-digested food was now a puddle at her feet, and there wasn't even room for her to sit up straight. The wrinkled pink flesh of the stomach walls pushed at her from all sides, jostling her around gently but incessantly, like it was trying to get her attention.\nShe kicked feebly back at the walls, unable to get the leverage to put any real strength into it. It felt like trying to punch quicksand. The walls of the giantess' stomach yielded to her motion, then pulsed, chewing hungrily on her foot.\nUnable to do anything else, frustrated and scared, she screamed. The air she breathed was hot and humid, everything she could touch and see was flesh, and, over the steady pounding of the woman's heartbeat, she could hear the muffled sound of her voice.\nWas this really any worse than being in her vagina would have been, though? At least there was room for her to move, if only a little. At least there was air to breathe, even if it reeked of half-digested food. It wouldn't be a terrible place to spend a month, but being eaten had been the most terrifying experience of her life.\nBecca eyed the bottom of the woman's stomach, where the grey puddle of food slowly drained into her intestines. There was more to this woman, much more. She couldn't pass at this size, but there was no telling when the giantess would shrink her down and send her on a tour through her digestive system. Even if her stomach was practically a hotel compared to her vagina, did she really want to go on that trip?\nJust five minutes ago, she had been buried head to toe in the vagina of a giantess. Now, she was sitting in the stomach of another. She had no control over her fate; she was just coming to understand that. If either of them felt the whim, she would shrink down to an eighth of an inch and slowly work through every twist and turn of the woman's intestines, drop out of her asshole with her shit as the final humiliation. \n\"No intentional humiliation.\" She understood that a little better now, and she hated herself for giving in to her horny urges. If she had just left well enough alone, she would probably be in class right now.  She could feel the woman walking; her heel striking the floor was marked with a dull thud, and the irregular pace bounced her up and down. Gravity shifted and she bent over, and Becca wound up with her feet over her head when she straightened back up. She had to fight for five minutes to right herself, cursing at the giantess, whose name she still didn't know, the entire time.\nThat seemed like deliberate humiliation, to eat someone without introducing yourself to them. Like she was just food. But this was 'anything goes,' as they said. Anything goes. For an entire month.\nAn entire fucking month.\n \n \n \nPaige went to the bathroom after letting Becca stew in her stomach for about ten minutes. She was vaguely aware of the shrunken girl moving around in her stomach, fighting back against the involuntary actions of her body, and she could feel the very distinct weight in her belly shifting around as she moved. The sensation was uncomfortable; a bit nauseating; like she had eaten too much and gone for a run. She shrank the tiny woman all the way down and stuck her fingers in the back of her throat, bringing her back up along with a few ounces of what was left from lunch.\nShe wiped her mouth, sized the woman up to an inch and cleaned her off, then plucked her out of the sink. She crouched down and rested her chin on the sink, meeting the tiny, naked woman eye-to-eye. She was so close and so small that Paige could have lapped her back up with her tongue. And, judging from the look on her face, she knew that.\n\"Hello, Becca.\" Paige said cheerfully. The sound of her voice must have been unbearable from her perspective, because the woman cringed and scrambled back. Paige giggled, then said, \"I work at X-Mart too, but my job is a bit different than yours; I teach women like you how to do their jobs, so you can think of me as your boss. You ready?\"\nBecca didn't respond, and Paige didn't wait for her to. She stood back up and grabbed the tiny woman with her right hand, keeping her confined in her fist, the remote in her other hand, as she went to her bedroom.\nPaige threw Becca carelessly onto the bed, followed with her remote, then locked the door. She pulled her shorts off and left them on the floor, then her panties. She tossed her underwear on the bed after Becca, and giggled when they landed on the tiny woman.\nAs Becca fought to work her way out of the discarded panties, Paige grabbed a dildo, a Bad Dragon number that was about nine inches long and as thick as her wrist, and climed onto the bed. She hid the dildo behind her back when she sat up, legs crossed, and pulled her panties off the shrunken woman.\n\"Peekaboo!\" she exclaimed, and laughed. \"Okay, show me what you can do!\"\nThe tiny girl didn't respond initially, looking up at Paige with shock, then her gaze shifted to her crotch. Paige knew what she looked like. She had gotten laser hair removal and even, once upon a time, surgery to trim down her labia. Her body was her craft, and it was worth the money to get a tight, smooth black pussy that belonged in pictures. Almost every job she had taken with a man, even the married ones, resulted in her getting fucked while tiny multiple times a day. \n\"C'mon!\" she urged the girl, bringing a hand down to pull her labia open. Dark flesh parted to reveal a sliver of the bright pink underneath. Becca was so tiny that she could probably get lost between her labia and not even enter her vagina. Paige could fix that in an instant, give the woman a fighting chance to actually please her, but that wasn't the point.\nSlowly, hesitantly, Becca approached Paige. She gave the shrunken woman only five seconds, then she made a big show of sighing, rolling her eyes, and grabbing the remote. Becca stopped and looked up with fear as Paige uncrossed her legs, backing away from her before she sized her up to the full two feet. \n\"On your knees,\" she ordered sternly. Becca obeyed, getting on her hands and knees. \"Turn around.\"\nBecca hesitated before she turned around, presenting Paige with her ass. She had a nice pussy too; she probably wouldn't need surgery, but she could stand to bleach her asshole. Paige leaned forward and put her left hand on the woman's head, pushing her facefirst into the mattress, then slowly slid the middle finger of her right hand into her vagina.\nShe heard the woman gasp, but ignored her. Even at a full two feet, Paige could fill her with just her finger up to the second knuckle. But that wasn't the plan.\nShe pulled out a bit, then worked her ring finger in as well. Becca moaned at that, and Paige talked over her. \"I don't know if you figured this out from when I ate you, but you're invincible. Most people don't really know what that means. What you can do with it.\"\nPaige started rapidly flexing her fingers, aggressively fingering the girl. She let loose a choked, pleasured scream, and Paige pushed her head harder into the mattress to muffle her. She could feel the tiny woman's vagina spasming around her fingers, but she kept going, heedless of her orgasm.\nAfter about five minutes, Paige felt that she was loosened up enough, and her vagina was so well lubed that it was staining her ass. She pulled her fingers out and produced the dildo, waving it in front of the tiny woman so she could see it. \"I was going to do this with a horse. Yes, an actual horse. My friend has a farm. But Holly made me promise not to.\"\nBecca was struggling now, but Paige had her pinned good. She didn't even have to try hard to keep her from moving. Her ass waved back and forth in protest, but she couldn't get her knees out from under her unless Paige let up. \nShe wasn't going to. It was going to get so much worse for the little girl. She placed the tip of the dildo, wider around than one of her legs, against her pussy, then slowly started to sink it in.\nPaige could feel the girl sobbing underneath her hand. \"This is just getting started, baby,\" she promised. She twisted the dildo as she slid it in further, inch by inch. By the time she got to the first ridge of the head, the girl's belly had distended and her hips had widened impossibly to accomodate the dildo's girth.\nIt was already deeper in than the length of her vagina, but her organs would stretch to prevent injury. Paige kept pushing deeper and deeper, until there was just enough left outside for her to keep her grip on the base. The dildo had entered the shrunken woman all the way up to the chest, pushing aside organs and pressing through her skin so clearly that Paige could see the individual ridges of the dildo.\nShe could see the pleasure on the girl's face. She was hardly able to breathe as orgasm wrecked her body. Her gaping mouth and flushed, vacant expression were almost cartoonish. Paige stood her upright by lifting the dildo and dragging her along with it. The woman's entire body stiffened, and fell limp; if Paige hadn't been holding onto the dildo, Becca wouldn't have been able to stand on her own two feet.\nPaige reached over and grabbed the remote, then shrank the girl all the way down. Every part of her body shrank to nothing, but the dildo was still inside her. Just like when she was two feet tall, her vagina would expand as necessary to admit the dildo, but the rest of her body was irrelevant. In an instant, Paige was no longer holding a person, but a dildo with a thin, flesh-colored condom.\nShe grinned. She had done this to herself a few times, with dildos, people, and once with the horse. Feeling something come inside you at the end was incomparable, and the horse was the best time she had had in months. Not because of its size, but because, when it was done, its cock would retreat into a sheath, and she had spent the next few days trapped in a world of flesh and limitless pleasure. She knew the horse must have pissed with her on its dick, maybe even fucked a mare, which was kind of gross to think about, but she didn't remember much. The whole experience was one orgasmic blur; she thought she would have been doing Becca a favor in letting her try it out.\nOh well. Next best thing. Paige straightened up, positioned the dildo, and slowly lowered herself onto it. She didn't have the blessings that Becca did, so she'd have to ease herself onto this nine-inch monstrosity. She felt it slowly enter her, and moaned in satisfaction, wondering to herself whether the shrunken woman had the presence of mind to realize what was happening to her right now. If it was anything like her own experience, there was nothing left in her world but sexual ecstasy, no sensation left but pleasure.\n","When the dildo was inside her, stretching her body to impossible proportions, Becca was fighting to keep conscious in the midst of incredible pleasure. Her entire body seized as another orgasm hit her, and she struggled to draw enough breath even to moan.\nShe could see the woman reaching for the remote, and she felt a pang of fear at what could come next before it was drowned out by another orgasm. Then, as she slowly recovered, the giantess shrank her all the way down, and her entire world was replaced by pure pleasure. \nFor all her life, 'orgasm' was a goal, an end state. A pinnacle of pleasure that meant she had accomplished what she meant to do. Whether it was a dick inside her, a dildo, or her own fingers, orgasm was the brief but powerful flood of pleasure that she had sought that meant that she was done.\nBut not now. There were no words to describe what she felt now. The overwhelming sensation of orgasm, the wave of pleasure that stole her senses from her and left her gasping helplessly, unable to control her body; that was her entire existence. Her vagina was filled in a way that overwhelmed every sense of penetration or clit play she had ever experienced. \nEcstasy filled her, controlled her, consumed her, leaving nothing left but pleasure. She was vaguely aware of her body, every muscle from head to toe seizing up with as much force as it could muster, but that was a footnote to the orgasm. Her breath came in short, desperate gasps, more fluid than air filling her lungs as the giantess slowly lowered her vagina on top of her, but that was only the backdrop to the electric sensation that rocked her body.\nShe knew what was happening to her. She could watch as the woman, whose name she still didn't know, lowered her body onto the dildo that filled her like nothing she ever knew. The dark-skinned ass and legs of the giantess filled her field of view, and the tight lips of her pussy parted and replaced everything with pink, wet flesh. None of it mattered to her, though. It was background noise, elevator music, a screensaver to her life as she lay naked in an endless field of pleasure.\nDid she come? Had she come already? Was she coming now? Did it matter? Maybe she was screaming, expelling more lubricant than air from her ruined throat. Maybe she was squirting, her body dispelling its pathetic fluid-based surrender to the infinite pleasure. She couldn't tell.\nShe was the dildo. She was the giantess' vagina. She was the orgasm. Reality was meaningless. Her own sight, touch, smell, and taste were all filled with the claustrophobic, overwhelming sense of the giantess' vagina, but it was only the background to her endless orgasm.\nOne tiny part of her brain, the only remant of her mind that remained lucid in this endless world of sexual pleasure, was aware of the giantess' actions. It watched as she brought her ass down on the dildo that filled her body, and it suffered as she bounced up and down on its massive bulk. Eventually, she knew, the massive woman would finish, and the next torture would follow.\nBut, for now, none of that mattered to her. All she knew was pleasure.\n \n Paige took about a minute to lower herself onto the dildo. It was gigantic. She could never really handle this dildo without a little bit of warm-up. The marbled blue rubber was replaced with the fleshy pink of the tiny woman, but that didn't make its size any easier to handle. \nEventually, she could feel the head pressing against her cervix. She let out a gasp, but kept pushing down, slow but steady. It was almost painful. It took about ten minutes, pulling off a bit before she pushed down again, letting her vagina expand to accept the massive dildo and its helpless passenger. But, eventually, she was able to get her ass over the knot and onto the dildo's rubber fascimile of a ballsack.\nShe let out a relieved sigh, wiggling her hips a little as she thought of what the little girl was going through down there. Lucky little bitch didn't have to work to get satisfying penetration. Being used as a human condom on a dildo may seem humiliating, but she knew from firsthand experience that humiliation would be the last thing on her mind at that moment. \nPaige, on the other hand, had to work for ten minutes to get something big enough inside her that she could feel the subtle but insistent pleasure that signaled the build to orgasm. Her breath came fast and heavy, and she felt her pelvic muscles squeeze unbidden, seeking some kind of reprieve from the pressure of the massive dildo inside her.\n\"Mmnh.\" Wait, was that her? She had made that noise? She giggled despite herself; that really was all that needed to be said; she could cum just sitting here. But, lest she forget, she had a passenger, and her helpless audience deserved a show. \nSlowly, both hands clamped on the base of the dildo, she lifted herself up, savoring every inch of it as it left her body, until it finally popped out. She let out a relieved breath, her pelvic muscles squeezing again, then sat back down on it. Another moan escaped her lips as she felt it enter her; it slid in so much easier this time; and she drove her hips further and further down until her ass hit the ground.\nOh, God, that felt good. She could just sit here, let the bulk of the dildo do the work and enjoy the rise to climax, but a hunger had settled in the pit of her stomach, and it would not be denied. Slowly, well aware of the limits of her own body, she started to bounce up and down. Only a few inches each way at first, but...\nJesus Christ! The orgasm hit her hard and fast; her entire body seized up, and it was all she could do to keep from falling down on top of the dildo. Her arms and legs shook, and she couldn't breathe in or out as pleasure washed up and down her body, until suddenly she heard herself cry in ecstasy, and then all she could do was gasp for air as she slowly came down.\nOh, fuck yes. This thing was worth taking the time to stretch for. Before she had even recovered all the way, she slowly slid the dildo all the way back inside her, then started humping it again. More and more length, with greater and greater speed each time. She hoped Becca had made herself comfortable down there.\nShe was in for quite a show.\n","Becca's slow return to consciousness meant that the ceaseless, mind-numbing pleasure had finally come to a close. The first thing she could really feel was a deep, profound soreness in her pelvic muscles. Everything below the waist screamed at her in exhaustion, the dull, deep-seated burn of a great workout but in places that she had never felt it before.\nHer vagina still tingled. She could feel her own heartbeat down there, and each pulse was a brief throb of pain that made her grimace. Fuck. How long had she been mounted on that goddamn dildo?\nOther senses came back slower. She was eventually aware of the heady stench of sex, filling her mind with a heat that belied the cool feeling of the air on her fluid-coated skin. The savory, almost fishy taste of the giantess' bodily fluids still filled her mouth. She smacked her lips and spat, a futile effort to clean her mouth of a taste that sank into the pores of her skin.\nFuzzy shapes and indistinct colors slowly resolved themselves into something distinguishable. The dark color of her new torturer's skin was the first thing she recognized, and her heart sank; her thin hope of having escaped this nightmare was dashed almost as soon as she had dared to feel it. \nEventually, she was able to tell that she was lying on a soft, pink bedspread, the thin, black-haired goddess who had trapped her in that sexual nirvana looming over her. She sat cross-legged, naked on the bed, the rigors of her sexual exercise still evident on her face. Sweat beaded her forehead, and her flushed cheeks glowed through the dark color of her skin. She held something small, a soft white glow cast on her face. Was that her phone? When she noticed that Becca was coming to, she tossed it behind her, looked down, and smiled.\nLast of all, Becca became aware of half-breathed moans escaping her mouth with every breath. She swallowed them down, suffering the persistent throbbing of her vagina in silence. \nWhat the fuck could she do? She doubted that she would even be able to walk, let alone try and run away. The giantess was still breathing heavy, recovering from the torture in her own way, but Becca could do nothing more than lie there, spread out like the fucking sex toy she was, on the matress and wait for her to determine how next to brutalize her.\nThat's all she was at this point, she realized with a sinking heart. A sex toy, a human dildo, a human condom, a living, breathing aphrodesiac to be used however her masters saw fit. She would have to endure this for an entire month, and she'd be lucky if she came out the other side with her sanity intact.\nThe giantess above her finally took a deep breath, and let it out in a giggly sigh. \"Whoo,\" she breathed, scooching up a little closer to Becca. Her little motion rocked the bed profoundly. The tiny woman bounced up and down like a canoe in a hurricane, bedsprings creaking underneath her. Still, she could barely muster the energy to move, and just bounced helplessly with the motion of the mattress.\n\"I think you enjoyed that more than me,\" she said. Fuck you, Becca thought, though all she expressed was a slight frown. As an experiment, she tried to lift one of her legs, but it could barely hold its own weight, and collapsed back down onto the bed.\n\"Yeah, I've been there before. It's a load of fun, but that's the last you're gonna get of it for now.\" She sighed again, deep with satisfaction. \"Oh! Where are my manners?\" She leaned forward and, with one, massive finger, poked Becca in the nose. \"My name is Paige. I'm going to teach you how to be tiny.\"\nShe had thought that a name would do her some good, but she didn't even feel like it had helped to resolve her hatred. Paige was still the black giantess who had cranked the dial on her sexual torture; her name didn't matter one way or the other. \nPaige reached behind her on the bed and produced what Becca recognized as her remote. God, she hated that thing almost as much as she hated this woman. With the remote in one hand, Paige reached down and scooped Becca up from the bed. Her stomach dropped as she flew through the air at a frightening speed, and found herself face-to-face with the giantess. Each of her eyes was bigger than she was, and she couldn't tear her gaze from those giant brown pupils as Paige's deafening voice echoed around her. \"I'm not gonnna use you as a dildo right now, but you've got a lot of my body to explore.\"\nWith that, the massive woman shifted her grip, and Becca was hanging upside down in front of her face. The giantess lifted her up a little more and opened her mouth, and her hot breath washed over Becca. White teeth ringed a pink, fleshy maw, her tongue twitching and the darkness of her throat leading down to places unknown.\nTerror lent her weary limbs strength, but it was useless. She struggled to the best of her ability, but it didn't stop Paige from lowering her tiny form onto her wet, hot tongue. Her fingers let go, and Becca got one last breath of fresh air before Paige closed her mouth.\nIn an instant, the outside world was replaced with the overwhelming heat and noise of the giantess' mouth. Her breathing was a steady wall of sound, her heartbeat a constant, booming pulse. The moment Paige closed her mouth, her tongue surged up, pressing Becca against her palate and writhing underneath her. It felt the curves and explored the taste of her flesh, determining if she was a morsel worth swallowing.\nBecca fought with everything she had, which wasn't much against the massive bulk of muscle that was the giantess' tongue. Her weak punches and kicks hardly made a dent as Paige rolled her around and deposited her in her cheek.\nHer mouth closed, and Becca was just barely able to pull her limbs clear before her jaw came slamming shut. Her tiny body was pressed helplessly against the hard bulk of the woman's teeth by the unyielding pressure of her cheek. \nBut that only lasted for a few seconds before, without warning, she shrank yet again. Suddenly, she was microscopic, swimming in a pool of saliva between Paige's gums and her cheek. The woman's teeth were as tall as she was now, but she barely had time to process it before the purple monster of her tongue came slithering between her jaws and pressed her mercilessly against the giantess' cheek.\nBut, as soon as the tremendous pressure drove the air from her lungs, Paige's tongue shifted, moving a wave of saliva around, and Becca found herself swimming around in a pool of the hot fluid in the center of her tongue. Before she could even gain her bearings, Paige's jaws opened, and Becca fell, along with a seemingly infinite quantity of fluid, into her open palm.\nThe sudden transition from the heat and stench of the giantess' mouth into the outside world was so shocking that she didn't realize that she had been regrown until she was a full six inches tall again, coughing up spit into the massive woman's hand.\n\"You want to be eaten?\" Paige asked, her voice almost painfully loud. \"You are pretty tasty...\"\nBecca felt the giantess' fingers pinch her waist, and she was hoisted into the air to stare down at Paige's open maw again. This time, she squirmed and fought with everything she had, and it didn't make a lick of difference.\nAfter a second's consideration, Paige closed her mouth, and lowered Becca into her other palm, still slick with saliva. \"I'd show you what a full tour was like,\" her booming voice said as Becca fought to right herself, \"But we don't have that time.\"\nPaige's grip shifted, her fist wrapping around Becca's tiny body and bringing her in a whiplash motion up to eye level. She had faced those fiercely intelligent brown eyes half a dozen times in the last ten minutes already, but that didn't stop them from being absolutely terrifying.\n\"Here's the God's honest truth,\" she said. \"I could use you as a Kegel workout or as a buttplug and there is nothing you could do about it. You deserve it, too, so we'll get to all that, but I think it's important you get a taste of your own medicine first.\"\nPaige drew Becca even closer to her face, to the point that it was clear that her pupil was larger than her head. Becca couldn't help but recoil, but there was nowhere to go when she was trapped in the giantess' fist. \"My boyfriend's coming over,\" Paige said. Her voice was so loud that Becca's squirming was nothing but a futile effort to cover her ears. But her hands were trapped. She just had to endure it.\n\"He's better. Better than anything you've ever felt, and I am going to enjoy it while you get to experience it firsthand,\" Paige said. \"You're going to be jealous of what you did to Holly, and, when we're done, I'm going to start the real lesson.\"\nWithout warning, Becca shrank to the point that Paige's hand was an infinite field of flesh. Her fingers were mountains that stretched to the sky on a faraway horizon. The tiny layer of fluid in her palm turned into a pool deep enough for her to swim in. Then, the seemingly immobile monolith of her middle finger came crashing down with incredible speed and slammed into her.\nThe pressure should have killed her. She honestly would have sworn that it did, until she came to and found herself trapped, spread-eagled, in a thin layer of fluid as the world around her whipped by with terrifying speed.\nShe got brief flashes of the giantess' body. Small tits that hung close to her chest with the dark brown splotches of her nipples resting in the middle. A stomach that was tense with muscle despite her cross-legged, slouching posture. Dark brown, silky-skinned thighs that led to a crotch that was so smooth that it seemed like it had never worn hair at all. The heat of arousal darkened her groin, turning her labia almost black save where the wrinkly flesh just barely parted, offering a sliver of the bright pink flesh underneath.\nHer left hand came down as well, spreading her vulva and turning the tight sliver into a wide pink petal of wet flesh, contrasting brightly with the dark skin that surrounded it. Becca had one last view of the intimate sight before she went rocketing towards it. The heat multiplied tenfold, and she was pressed mercilessly against the woman's vulva, her world replaced by an endless field of pink wetness.\nPaige didn't move her around much, but each twitch was a mind-boggling blur of motion, soft flesh ripping across Becca's face. Finally, she came to rest in a tight pocket of flesh, pink skin surrounding her and the giant fingers of the giantess stretching into the distance just beyond. She just barely had the time to realize where she was before Paige pulled her left hand away, and her labia came snapping shut, replacing her view of the outside world with one of pink, wrinkly flesh stretching in every direction, pressing down on her from all angles and holding her helpless against seemingly infinite pressure and fluid.\nBecca knew exactly where she was. She knew her own body enough that even the brief flashes she got of Paige positioning her were enough. She was right outside, right underneath the giantess' vagina, not fully inserted yet but close enough to be completely surrounded by fluid and flesh, subject to all the gross biological functions that most women only thought about when they took off their underwear and saw the stain in the crotch. If Paige just decided to finger herself, or even if someone gave her head, Becca might be spared, but, otherwise...\nThis was the worst place to be, Becca realized. She couldn't escape, and if the giantess decided to have sex, she would be at ground zero. And what had she said? You get a taste of your own medicine.\nShe cursed, fighting futilely at the tons of flesh that surrounded her. This was going to be miserable.\n","Paige waited almost all day before she even bothered inviting her boyfriend over. Holly didn't need to be party to this, anyway, so, with only a bit of persuasion, she got her roommate to finally leave the house and head to the movies. She had more than a month of missed culture to catch up on, after all, and what better way to start than The Avengers?\nAbout two minutes after she heard Holly's car pull out of the driveway and drive off, she heard another car pull up. She slid her shorts off, kicked them under the bed, and raced towards the door just in time to leap on top of her boyfriend the moment he stepped inside.\nHe struggled not to fall over as she clamped her legs around him. If he fell, so be it; she'd drag him inside and sit on his face. But he grabbed the doorframe and managed to stay on his feet. When he regained his balance, he grabbed her head and pressed his lips up against hers. She felt his tongue worming up into her mouth, and she returned the gesture, sucking on his face and breathing deep like his scent was the only air she could breathe.\nBefore she knew what was happening, she was sitting on his face anyway, her pants and panties off, hands on either side of the man's head as he sucked insistently on her pussy. She didn't even think about the tiny girl stuffed away down there; Becca would either wind up inside her or she wouldn't, and she could figure it out from there.\nBesides, it's not like she and her boyfriend hadn't played with tinies before.\n Becca's first glimpse of light came hours later, and she knew immediately that she was about to have a miserable time. Paige had spread her legs far enough that the slit of her pussy had parted, just barely, and a thin sliver of the outside world was visible beyond the seemingly infinite field of flesh that she was trapped in. \nAnd all she could see was the face of another man beneath her, and she got a glimpse of the hunger in his eyes just before Paige lowered her hips and planted her crotch right on his face.\nImmediately, his lips clamped down on her clit like he was trying to pull the soul out of the giantess, and he started to suck and lick with a will. His chin was so close to Becca that she could almost reach out and touch it. It would have been a sexy, almost inspiring thing to see if she hadn't been so tiny, if she hadn't been so close. One violent movement and she would tumble down onto the man's chest, or if he decided to explore the giantess' inside with his tongue, she might very well end up falling down his throat.\nSo, despite herself, she kept trying to tuck herself even deeper into the folds of the giantess' flesh, watching the gyrations of the giant's mouth with fear. \nSuddenly, the flesh underneath her seized up, and, over the squelching that was happening right in front of her, she could hear Paige let out a little moan. The bundled-up flesh that led down to the dark maw of her vagina pressed hard together and pushed outwards, squeezing Becca further down into her little pocket. \nThe first of many contractions, she knew. And, sure enough, a few seconds later, it happened again, her view briefly and partly obscured by the way the giantess' vagina pushed fiercely outwards. God, her pelvic muscles were incredible. Becca knew that her own body wasn't capable of that much strength, and she knew from firsthand experience that Holly wasn't either.\nShe realized with growing dread that she'd probably be suffering under that strength eventually, probably very soon. But there was no escape for her, and, even if there was, she wouldn't take it. The horror of being swallowed by the giantess was still present in her mind, and she did not want to relive it, least of all in the gullet of a man who didn't even know she was there. \nShe definitely had a new appreciation for what Holly had experienced when trapped in her womb, but, unfortunately, she couldn't end this with a meek \"I have seen the error of my ways and I am sorry.\" She had to endure this shit for an entire month. Be it in Paige's vagina or the stomach of the giant man who was sucking on her clit like the answer to life's questions was in there. If she had the choice, though, she'd rather spend it with someone who actually knew she was there.\nShe didn't have a choice, though. Far above her, Paige finally reached climax, and all Becca could do was hang on as muscles infinitely stronger than she was bucked and seized all around her. Whatever she did didn't even make a difference; a thick layer of fluid held her fast against the heat and stench of the giantess' crotch, and, though her tiny limbs were far too weak to fight against it, all the man had to do was lick her up, and she would be sent on a one-way trip down into his stomach.\nEventually, the contractions finally finished, and Paige got off of the man's face. Becca's tiny window to the outside world disappeared as the giantess' closed her legs, but the sudden sensation of motion told her that the woman had stood up. Over the gentle thudding of her heartbeat, she could hear the massive booms of her feet hitting the floor, and then, without warning, gravity shifted ninety degrees. Becca had been facing down, then she was suddenly standing up, gravity gently carrying her downwards through the fluid and deeper into the bottom pocket of the woman's labia.\nPaige had laid down, Becca realized, and on her back. Things were about to get much worse, she realized, and her fears were confirmed when Paige spread her legs just enough to offer Becca her narrow view of the outside world again.\nShe had already sunk far enough down that she couldn't see much more than what was directly above the giantess, but what she saw was enough. The man was completely naked, his hard cock seeming impossibly long. His massive, muscular body loomed over the giantess as he brought his dick down. He tapped it twice against her pubic mound, and then all Becca could see was the wrinkled, purple head as he slowly brought it down against Paige's vagina, and slowly, purposefully slid himself inside her.\nPaige gasped at the sensation of entry, as Becca had before, but the shrunken woman didn't really hear it. All she saw and heard was the tremendous bulk of the man's penis effortlessly spreading tons of flesh apart, sliding with a wet noise deeper and deeper inside. Every fold of Paige's vulva followed it, including the tiny pocket that Becca was sheltered in. \nAs the man pushed slowly deeper and deeper, Becca was drawn closer and closer, riding helplessly along with the elastic flesh of the giantess' pussy as it expanded to accomodate her lover. By the time he came to a stop, his pelvis barely an inch away from her crotch, Becca was so close to his dick that she could literally reach up and touch it. \nShe couldn't see any part of the outside world anymore. It was just the pink flesh of Paige's vulva and the veiny bulk of the man's cock. Just an inch deeper and she would have been dragged in. All she could do was pray that she would be able to ride it out from here.\nBut no such luck. As slowly and deliberately as he had penetrated the giantess, the man pulled his dick out of her. The flesh that held Becca bent along with the motion, but didn't bring her any further away from the massive member, and didn't offer her any view of the outside world. All she could see was the veiny flesh passing by her, ripping through the giantess' vagina like it wasn't the insurmountable muscular beast that it was at her tiny size.\nThen, at the last second, the mushroom head of the man's penis popped out, and it was just big enough that it caught Becca up under the ridge, and the thin layer of lubricant that now coated his dick snatched her up and carried her off of Paige's vagina. \nOh no. She was fucked. But before she could even try to struggle her way to freedom, the giant plunged his dick back inside the giantess, and started to drill her with ferocious speed.\nThe heat and the sound was multiplied tremendously. At first, Becca couldn't see anything but the cock that pressed against her face, and could only suffer as the flesh of the woman's vagina pressed her mercilessly into it. But it only took a few thrusts before the sheer violence peeled her out from under the man's cock and deposited her inside of Paige's vagina.\nThere was no safety there. There was no safety anywhere. Every thrust was a whirlwhind, incomprehensible pressure accompanied by nauseating motion. She was driven deep into the woman's vagina, then pulled all the way out. She had to endure the ridges of the man's cock sliding mercilessly over her face, then she was rolled between vagina and dick like dust between her fingers. She endured brief, blinding flashes of the outside world, then had to suffer on the tip of the man's penis as the giantess' cervix slammed against her face over and over again.\nIn only a few minutes, she was personally acquainted with every inch of both the man and the woman's genitals, with speed and force that should have torn her to shreds in seconds. But she was doomed to survive, and to suffer through every painful minute of it. It seemed like it took hours, but there was no way to tell. She screamed futilely, slimy vaginal fluids escaping her mouth instead of air, but drowned out by the deafening, wet sounds of the giants' lovemaking.\nThe man came without warning. Becca was trapped underneath the bottom of his cock when it suddenly flexed, and she was small enough that she could feel the fluid moving through it. She gagged, and the man started to pull out, as quickly as he had before. The tons of lubricant that surrounded her kept her from being carried along with it, and she had to suffer as its bulk dragged over her face and finally departed, leaving behind it a massive pool of thick, white semen.\nBut the man wasn't done. Through the milky haze, Becca saw his cock flex one more time, and another torrent of fluid shot out, sending her whirling around in the mix of bodily fluids. Then he drove himself back in, once, twice, three times. Each time, he pushed his little pool of cum deeper into Paige's vagina, and Becca was carried helplessly along like driftwood.\nFinally, he pulled out, and even that motion was unbelievably chaotic to Becca. She was carried along with the fluid a little bit towards the outside of the giantess' vagina, but as the walls came closing back together, they displaced the salty mix of cum and lubricant, squeezing Becca back into the depths of the giantess' vagina. \nShe eventually came to a rest in a pool directly underneath the massive woman's cervix. The tiny chamber at the end of her vagina pulsed impatiently, hoping for more, but, thankfully, the giant couple was done. All Becca could do was sit in the sweltering heat, swallowing lungful after lungful of the slimy, sticky fluids, and listen as the giantess' heartbeat slowly began to calm.\nJesus Christ. It was a miracle she wasn't dead, but, to be honest, it was all she wanted right now. It wouldn't be a dignified way to die, but it would be better than living this miserable life, even if it was only for a month. \nBut they were done. Finally. That's what mattered. No matter what torture Paige came up with next, it would still be better than this. All she had to do was wait for the giantess to let her out. \nShe would let her out, wouldn't she?\n","Paige and her boyfriend both lay in bed, naked from head to toe, breathing hard with satisfied smiles on their faces. Eventually, Paige let out a deep, contented sigh and said \"That was fun.\" \"Yeah...\" her boyfriend agreed quietly. After a moment, he asked,\n\"You have a little dude down there with you?\"\n\"How'd you know?\"\n\"I saw him when I ate you out.\"\n\"You didn't swallow her, did you?\" Paige asked, suddenly worried.\n\"Oh, it's a 'her?' New coworker?\"\n\"Kind of,\" Paige said, wriggling her hips a bit. \"But seriously...\"\n\"No, I didn't eat her.\"\n\"Okay, good.\" Paige rolled over onto her side, laying her arm across her boyfriend's chest and wrapping a single leg around his torso. \"Why do you ask?\" she said in a husky voice.\nHe looked at her, the mischevious look on his face matching the one on hers. \"I have a few ideas.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nHer boyfriend put his head back against the pillow and crossed his fingers behind his head. Paige couldn't help but notice the firm lump of his bicep that bundled up when he did so. She let her finger drift gently across it as he said, \"I'll tell you in a bit.\"\n\"Mmm,\" she agreed wordlessly, drawing her body against him. The heat of his body was a reassuring refuge against the chilly feel of the air on her sweaty skin.\nFor a long moment, he lay there, his eyes closed, and Paige just watched his chest slowly rise and fall. Eventually, in a quiet, almost sleepy voice, he asked, \"Are you tiny too?\"\n\"Mm, not today,\" Paige said softly.\nHer boyfriend made a quiet sound of assent. Then, after a few more moments of silence, he asked, \"Are you punishing her?\"\nPaige grinned. \"A little bit, yeah.\"\n\"That's good.\"\nPaige let her leg drift a little bit further down his body, until the inside of her thigh was pressed up against his crotch. She felt it stir ever so slightly at her touch, and she asked, \"Why?\"\n\"I don't think I can tell you,\" he answered. \"I have to show you.\"\nThat sentence set her heartrate up all on its own. She felt a stirring between her own legs, and her hips ground up against him almost unbidden. \"Well? What are you waiting for?\"\nHe shot her a grin. \"Where's the remote?\"\n\"Dresser.\"\nAfter a long, almost regretful sigh, he climbed out of bed with a grunt. Paige could see in his sluggish, sloppy movements that he was fighting back sleep already. Best to seem eager then; she rolled onto her back, lifting her knees and presenting a crotch that was still wet with fluids. Her boyfriend went and grabbed the remote, studying the buttons. A pang of worry crossed her mind. \"Careful,\" she said sternly. She had no idea where the shrunken woman was, and sizing her up too quickly could rupture something, turn this romantic afternoon into a hospital trip. \n\"Don't worry,\" he assured her, and slowly, almost painfully slowly, started to move the size slider up.\nThe pressure developed so subtly that Paige barely even noticed it, until the bulge in her pelvis was visible. \"Stop, stop, stop,\" she urged, placing a hand gently on the bulge. The tiny woman stopped growing instantly, but Paige couldn't really tell where she was from the sense of pressure alone. A brief wave of panic hit her; had she let the tiny girl get lost in her womb? God, that'd be the entire month wasted.\nBut then the tiny girl moved, and Paige let out a sigh of relief. The sensation came unmistakeably from inside her vagina, which meant that she could recover the tiny woman with a pair of fingers and a bit of digging.\nBut her boyfriend beat her to it. He had his hand between her legs before she could stop him, and slowly slid his middle two fingers up inside her vagina. The feeling of entry really was like nothing else, and Paige let her head fall back, a gasp escaping her lips.\nAfter a few seconds of pushing deeper and deeper, her boyfriend managed to grab Becca by one of her tiny limbs, and slowly drew her out of Paige's body. The shrunken woman had grown enough that the mere sensation of her exiting Paige's pussy was pleasurable, and her pelvic muscles gave a light, involuntary squeeze. Paige let out a giggle; the bitch would be feeling a lot more than that very soon.\nHer boyfriend drew the tiny woman all the way out and held her up by her ankle, leaving her dangling upside-down, fluids practically dripping from her skin. \"Babe, you've got her so wet,\" he said. \nPaige moaned in agreement, waiting for what he was going to do next. And he didn't disappoint. With the hand that wasn't holding the tiny woman, he gripped her ass and tilted her hips up as far as he could. Then he climbed up on the bed and put his knees under her ass, propping her hips up so that everything from her clit to her asshole was exposed to the open air.\nPaige's legs wrapped around her man instinctively, and he spread her asscheeks with one hand and brought the tiny down with the other. Then, making a kissing noise with his mouth, he slowly slid Becca headfirst into Paige's asshole.\nPaige let out a bit of a moan. It wasn't comfortable, but it wasn't completely without pleasure, either. If anything, it made her hornier, feeling the woman's body slowly sliding into her ass. Push her in, she begged silently. Push her in all the way. I want her to live there.\nIt was probably for the best that her boyfriend didn't hear her thoughts, though. He pushed Becca in down to her knees, then let Paige's ass fall back to the bed. Even the pressure of the woman's upper body inside her felt incredible, and she knew exactly what was coming next. \nShe spread her legs wide, biting her lip and meeting her boyfriend's eyes. She spread her legs as far as she could as he walked up, erect penis in hand, and slowly slid himself inside her.\nIt was fun to think of what the poor tiny woman was enduring inside her, but only for the first few moments. Not long after her boyfriend started his diligent work, Paige forgot about everything but the profound intimacy and pleasure of the moment.\nOne thing she knew for sure, though. Becca would never forget it.\n"," God, the stench. Becca wanted to scream, but she didn't want to breathe. In the few moments before the man had slid her into the giantess, she had smelled it, a preview of what she was about to experience, wafting up from between her spread asscheeks. Nausea had set in even before her head was pressed against the tight black wrinkle of Paige's asshole, but she could never have known how bad it would be on the other side. \nOppressively hot, slimy flesh wrapped tight around her body, seeking almost to pull her deeper. She could feel the thick fluids on her skin, and her instincts told her to recoil, but there was nowhere to retreat to. The massive woman's heartbeat was deafening, the skin around her pulsing gently with every beat, veins clearly visible through the pale-pink flesh. \nBut nothing compared to the smell. It was foul. She gagged, squirming and twisting, but there was no escape. If anything, she just made it worse by disturbing the flesh around her. Every breath carried a hot, heady taste, and her own body wouldn't just let her hold her breath to avoid it. \nShe was vaguely aware of the motion of the giantess' body, of the fact that her legs below the knees were bent down as the massive woman's ass hit the mattress. The assault on her senses was so profound that she didn't really notice what was going on, and she didn't care. At least until the man, who had already spent the last thirty minutes torturing her, slid his dick into the giantess. \nIn her anatomy texbook, all the diagrams showed the anus and the vagina right next to each other. It was something she knew, but not something she had ever thought about. But now that little bit of biology was eminently, painfully clear. She could practically feel the ridges of the man's cock sliding over her face, pressing the walls of Paige's asshole up against her. The flesh around her, already tight, pressed down even harder, making room for the giant's bulk. Slimy fluid forced its way into her mouth, and the awful taste made her spit and cough ferociously. \nWhen the man started fucking his giant lover, he did so with deep, deliberate strokes, and every one felt like getting run over by a truck. Over, and over, and over, and over again. When he picked up speed, it just got worse. Becca was held fast in her position, unable to move further into or out of the giantess' body by the sheer weight that pressed down on her.  \nPaige's asshole flexed around her knees, with growing frequency and strength as the man drove in and out of her. Over the deafening pounding of moving flesh and rapid heartbeats, she could hear the massive woman moaning, muffled by the tons of flesh that surrounded her. \nGod, it was awful. Becca swallowed a mouthful of the slimy fluid that surrounded her, and immediately started coughing, but the driving force of the giant's dick forced more fluid into her lungs with every breath. It never got any better, and the stench, the taste of it never got any less sickening. \nIt was hopeless; all she could do was pray for a death that would never come. And to think that all this was happening because she couldn't resist fucking her boyfriend with a tiny passenger. \nEventually, the man finally finished. Had it been an hour? Two? Five minutes? All Becca knew was that the motion finally stopped, followed by a distant, but distinctly male grunt. Finally, he pulled his dick out of the giant woman, leaving Becca to stew in the horrible stench and slimy fluid of Paige's asshole. \nIt was awful. Fucking awful. But it was still relatively pleasant.\n Paige lay there, her legs still spread wide, gasping in the fading glow of pleasure, barely even noticing the tiny woman inside her. Her boyfriend stood over her, triumphantly looking down at her like an artist would regard his masterpiece. She felt his gaze on her bare crotch, on the thin trickle of fluid that oozed out of it, and she let him look. Two runs in thirty minutes, and more orgasms than she could count. Fuck, he was good. \nFinally, with a sigh, he collapsed onto the bed next to her, draping an arm across her chest. Paige didn't move, her legs still spread wide, but eyed his flushed face with a smile.  \n\"Oh, fuck,\" he breathed. \nPaige's smile widened, and she giggled. She felt a bit more fluid eke out as she did, and the little woman seemed to struggle a bit. \"Yeah,\" she agreed. \n\"Now what?\" \"What? You had this big plan for her.\" \n\"That wasn't enough?\" \"I've got her for a month, babe,\" Paige replied, her grin turning sultry. \nHer boyfriend groaned, rolling onto his back. \"Fuck. You'll wring me dry.\" \nPaige rolled over on top of him, straddling his waist. She put both hands on his chest, feeling even more fluid drip out of her vagina. Christ, his flesh felt almost feverishly hot under her hands. \"Come on,\" she said in a husky voice, blowing a strand of hair out of her eyes.  \n\"Babe...\" \nShe started sliding her hips up and down a little bit, savoring the feel of the tiny woman moving around inside her as she ground her crotch against his. He was soft, and she could barely feel even the slightest twitch. \"Come on,\" she insisted. \nBoth of his hands clamped onto her ass without warning, and she froze, letting out a little squeak. He spread her asscheeks wide, and she let him, tilting her hips a bit to give him better access. His fingers found Becca's legs, and he pulled the tiny woman out carefully. Paige let out a subvocal moan as the shrunken toy left her body, and her boyfriend brought her up between them, holding her by the ankle. \n\"What do you think... what's her name?\" \n\"Becca.\" \n\"What do you think, Becca? Should we go again?\" \nThe tiny girl was hopelessly disoriented, a panicked look on her face as she tried to process the sudden shift in her surroundings. Paige knew that feeling; it only went away with practice. Eventually, she shook her head, her eyes wide with fear. \n\"That's two to one, babe,\" her boyfriend said. \nPaige grabbed his hand, the one that held the shrunken woman, and shoved it down into the mattress. Her body followed, pressing up against his, their faces only inches away. \"She doesn't count,\" she whispered. \nHer boyfriend closed his eyes, though his contented smile didn't fade. \"I can't, babe. Sorry.\" \nPaige made a show of rolling her eyes, and straightened up. She brushed her hair back, then gave her boyfriend a grin, a little note to say that she wasn't really that disappointed. \"Where's the remote?\" \nHe reached back, his hand groping into a pile of pillows; apparently, they had tossed the remote about a little bit. Eventually, he produced the little box, and Paige eagerly snatched it from his hands. She pressed the 'clean' button, and, hand on the size slider, said, \"Give her here.\" \nHe raised an open palm, presenting a four-inch naked woman struggling to get to her feet. Paige plucked her up between thumb and forefinger, then sized her all the way down. \n\"Seems like my boyfriend is tired,\" she said, speaking to the mote of dust between her fingers. She scooted back a bit, and lowered the tiny woman down to the man's cock. It glistened with bodily fluids, and she grabbed it and pulled back his foreskin. \"See if you can't wake him up.\" \nShe placed the woman under the head of his dick, right on the thin tissue that ran down from his urethra, then rolled his foreskin forwards. The woman vanished under the soft flesh, and there was nothing left afterwards to indicate that she was even there. \nPaige got up from the bed with a sigh. \"I'm going to go clean up. Let me know if that works.\"\n","This was still just the first day. That's all Becca could think about as she lay, immobile, trapped underneath the unforgiving pressure of the man's foreskin. She had barely been at this for eight hours, and she already wanted to die. Did she really have to deal with a whole month of this?\nThe heat was incredible; she never seemed to get used to how hot it was. The only sound she could hear was the man's booming heartbeat, the only thing she could see was the dark skin of the giant's cock pressed up against her. Every breath came with a struggle against the pressure, and it filled her lungs with the hot, slimy mix of lubricant and semen that the man had carried out of Paige's body. \nShe tried, briefly, to struggle, but realized immediately that her best efforts would not even budge the flesh around her. Worse, the thick, salty fluids that enveloped her kept her from gaining purchase against the smooth skin of the giant's dick. All her kicking and flailing did nothing but wear her out.\nFuck. Now what? Paige had put her here very deliberately, so she could only imagine that she had even more perverted torture in the works. She didn't want to think about it, but she couldn't stop her mind from speculating what new and inventive things that Paige could do to her.\nShe had already done so much more than Becca would have thought possible, and then there was that thing with the horse... She said she had promised not to, but who could say what would happen in a month? Just the idea of being fucked by a barnyard animal, no matter what size she was... And she'd have no say in it at all; she'd have to endure whatever it was until Paige got bored.\nBecca kicked at the flesh around her, again, to no effect, and screamed in frustration. She was fucking tired of being helpless. She was a human being, goddammit, not a toy. But her fiercest struggles did nothing; it was immediately clear that there was nothing she could do, no matter how indignant she was. \nShe lay back, furious at her helplessness. Then, at that moment, the man's foreskin drew back, washing her body in light and cold air. She twisted around, pulling herself partially free of the residual fluids, and saw Paige's mouth closing around her.\nBecca screamed, but Paige had already clamped her mouth around the giant's cock. The massive woman's tongue slimed up against her back, pressing her against the flesh before it dragged her free. It all happened so fast. One moment, she was face-down against the dark skin of the man's penis, the next, she was rocketing into the air, Paige's tongue at her back, as the giantess' lips closed around her.\nThe last thing she saw, before she was plunged into the darkness of the giant woman's mouth, was the naked body of the man who had tortured her for the last hour. To her surprise, he was sleeping, his flaccid cock lying limp between his legs.\nThen Paige's mouth slammed shut, enveloping her darkness, heat, and the stench of her spit. The giantess' tongue surged up underneath her, and, for one, terrifying moment, Becca thought she was about to be swallowed. She flailed wildly, trying to escape the darkness of the woman's throat behind her, but it was useless; Paige's tongue was ten times her size, anything that happened to her was only because the giantess willed it.\nThen Paige's mouth opened, her tongue reaching out into the open air, and her thumb and forefinger reached up and plucked Becca off the wet, saliva-soaked surface. \nThe motion was quick and dizzying. Becca got a glimpse of a dimly-lit bedroom, disheveled bedsheets, a naked man asleep, a naked woman standing, and then her vision was filled with the giantess' piercing gaze. Dark brown eyes, each larger than her, stared her down with a hungry expression.\nPaige's lips twitched briefly into a smile, then she spoke. At this size, her voice seemed like the word of God, \"So, what do you think?\" she asked. \"Inside or outside?\"\nBecca tried to get her bearings, flailing uselessly with her body trapped between the giantess' fingers. She barely even heard the question. Inside or outside?\nPaige rolled her eyes and tossed Becca down onto the bedsheets. In an instant, she soared miles through the air and landed like a comet on an infinite landscape of cloth. She hit the surface so fast that it drove the wind out of her and left her gasping, smooth cotton seeming as hard as rock at that sped. She was only vaguely aware of the giantess, holding the size remote in her hands and staring down at her.\nThen everything around her seemed to grow smaller. It took her a moment, coughing from the impact and trying desperately to catch her breath, to realize that the giantess had sized her up. Not much, only to three, maybe four inches, but it was miles above where she had been before.\nPaige leaned down, her hand slamming down right next to Becca. The tiny woman fell straight onto her ass, staring up at the giantess' face in terror as she spoke again, \"Inside or outside?\"\n\"Wh... What?\" she stuttered.\nPaige rolled her eyes. Then her hand, with terrifying speed, scooped Becca up off the bedsheets and lifted her to the giantess' face. \"I want to come,\" the massive woman said patiently. \"So how are you going to do it? Do you want to be inside me or outside?\"\nBecca gaped. What the fuck... \n\"God, you're useless,\" Paige decided. \"Try it on the outside. If you can't, well...\"\nPaige opened her hand, and Becca was suddenly falling. Falling, falling, falling, seemingly forever. She saw the giantess' body pass by her, her smooth belly, her naked crotch, her thin legs, and then she hit the ground.\nThe impact made everything go dark for a moment, and, when she came to, she was gasping like a fish out of water, trying to catch her breath from the fall. \nThe giantess stood above her, straddling her tiny body. She could see the seemingly infinite dark columns of the woman's legs leading up to the swollen lips of her pussy, the muscular folds of her ass. Even further above, past her tight, flat belly, were the sizable lumps of her breasts, big enough to hide her face completely.\nIt was one hell of a view. Then, with terrifying speed, the giantess leaned forwards, placing her hands on either side of her feet. She made eye contact with Becca for a brief moment, and gave her a little wink.\nOh, fuck. Becca realized what was happening just a second too late. She wasn't on the ground, she was lying face-up in a smooth, cotton hammock, and the giantess had a grip on either side of her. Becca twisted, and saw that she was lying square in the gusset of the massive woman's panties.\nThe moment Becca realized where she was, Paige pulled her underwear up, and Becca watched the giantess' crotch come flying at her with terrifying speed. In an instant, she was buried in the hot, soft flesh, the fresh air of the outside replaced immediately with the heady, fishy smell of the massive woman's pussy.\nOverwhelming heat surrounded her, and she started to sweat immediately. There was no reprieve, though; hot flesh enveloped her entire body, pounding with the giantess' heartbeat. Becca squirmed helplessly, trying to grab a breath of cool, fresh air, but she was trapped. She was cocooned in wet, pink flesh, and every breath she took was thick with salty lubricant. There was no way for her to be more a slave to Paige's pussy.\nThe giantess took a step forward, and her entire world shook; Paige's hip lifted up with her leg, and Becca felt the motion like she was strapped to the underside of a roller coaster. Then Paige's foot hit the ground with a deafening boom, the force rippling up through the giantess' flesh and shaking Becca's entire world.\nThe next step followed immediately after, before Becca had even recovered from the first one. The motion was rapid, irregular, and, combined with the overbearing heat and stench, she started to feel a little nauseous.\nShe had been here before, with Holly, and that giantess had given her the same task. She had failed then, and she had no idea how she would succeed this time. With her face buried so deep in Paige's vulva that all she could see was the pink flesh hidden beneath the dark folds, she had no chance of finding her way around. Even worse, the pressure exerted by the panties at her back, and by the flesh around her, made it almost impossible for her to really move. She couldn't imagine how she would stimulate the woman to orgasm in this spot.\nShe was still outraged at how helpless she was, and she didn't really even want to try. She didn't want to give the giantess that satisfaction. A month was a month, and it would be miserable if she did what this massive woman wanted her to, or if she was just used as a helpless toy the entire time. She could at least get something out of having held out for the whole awful experience.\nThe arrythmic pounding of the giantess' gait suddenly cut short, and she heard the woman's voice, far above her, shouting to be heard through the tons of flesh that surrounded her. She felt it in the vibration through Paige's body more than she heard it. \"Hey!\" she demanded. \"Are you even trying down there?\"\nBecca offered a savage kick in response, but she couldn't get any decent leverage. Her foot just slid between the massive woman's labia and stuck there. The giantess' response to this was muted, barely audible at all, \"Well, you know what'll happen if you don't...\"\nFuck. Fuck this. \"Fuck you!\" Becca screamed. Or, at least, she tried to scream. When she took a breath, she drew in more fluid than she expected, and was reduced to a violent coughing fit for the next minute. Paige started walking again while she sucked down and hacked up bodily fluids, and Becca finally got control of herself, punching and kicking futilely at the spongy skin that surrounded her.\nWhen she tired herself out from thrashing around in fluid-soaked, quicksand-like flesh, she just lay there, breathing the slimy lubricant and not even caring, her body twisted around at awkward angles. You know what? she thought. Fuck you, and fuck your twisted shit, bitch. \nThe sentiment was fine, but there wasn't much she could really do. She wasn't about to squirm her way to freedom, and, even if she did, she would just fall to the ground, and Paige would scoop her up as she lay gasping from the impact that followed the fall. Her fury at her helplessness just kept her rage alive and impotent. \nAfter a few minutes, when she had finally caught her breath and started trying to push herself into a more comfortable position, her world was flooded with light, and a blessed gust of fresh air washed across her face. She twisted around, and saw the giantess' ebony fingers reaching down past the elastic waistband of her panties to grab her head.\nIn a dizzying blur of motion, Paige ripped Becca out from the crotch of her panties and brought her tiny body right up to her giant face. Becca was completely overwhelmed by the sudden transition, but the giantess gave no time for her to recover. Her face was quite level, and her voice lacked expression, but the words she spoke sent a shiver of fear down Becca's spine.\n\"Time's up.\"\n","Becca was meant to fail, but, honestly, it felt like she had tried harder than Paige expected, at least for a little while. Without any real direction, though, it wasn't much more than vaguely pleasurable. Paige wasn't too surprised; the girl was new at this, and probably wasn't all that willing, either.\nOnly time would solve the first problem, but Paige wouldn't get any real results unless she also solved the second. To that end, she had a proven method. For all her talk about punishing the tiny girl, there was really only one way, in her experience, to make an unwilling woman into a willing toy.\nThe principle was straightforward enough. Why did people so eagerly share their favorite music? Why did people take it as a personal offense that you didn't enjoy the book they recommended? People get personal satisfaction from sharing experiences that they enjoyed, and sexual gratification was no different.\nThe problem was biology, along with cultural and moral hang-ups that almost everybody had, that kept people from expressing the same opinions about sex that they had about a movie they loved. Paige, however, suffered none of those biases, and Becca's unique situation, with her size and her resiliency, meant that Paige could work through those physical barriers that kept people from enjoying sex any more than their body demanded of them.\nIn part, it was why men were so rare in her field. Their experience with sex was of biological imperative followed by abrupt release, the 'little death,' as the French put it. The only men she knew with her job were the ones with the discipline to work literally past the point of 'death.' Male applicants at XMart were innumerable, but men who actually made it past the trial period that she and her female coworkers administered were incredibly rare.\nPaige relied heavily on a single tool to get the job done when she had an unwilling female toy. A small, pill-sized bullet vibrator, the smallest she could find, connected by a thin cord to a battery pack that she had customized for extra capacity. It was extremely tiny, and, due to its size, not all that strong, either; if she left it nestled right up against her clitoris, she might get one orgasm before the battery died. It was just cheap Chinese shit trying to capitalize on women looking for a 'discreet' way to pleasure themselves, but it suited her perfectly.\nShe dug the vibrator out from her sock drawer as the tiny woman in her panties tired herself out. The batteries were dead, so she had to give Becca a few more moments to calm down and catch her breath before returning to her room. She tossed the vibrator down on the bed right next to Becca's remote, then reached into her underwear and pulled the tiny woman out by her head.\nShe transferred the shrunken girl to her other hand, holding her in a fist in front of her face, and eyed her tiny body. Her skin, soaked in lubricant, was flushed from the heat, and her eyes were wide and scared. \n\"Time's up,\" she said, trying not to grin.\nBecca's expression, if anything, seemed to grow even more fearful, and Paige flicked her tiny body onto the bed, right in view of the remote and the vibrator. Then she leaned forward, slowly to make her relative size seem that much more intimidating, and placed a single finger delicately on the tiny woman's size slider.\nShe waited until she could see the fear in Becca's eyes, then, letting a half-smile creep into her expression, she slid the tiny woman all the way up to her full two feet. The look of shock on the woman's face as the world shrank around her was absolutely worth the theatrics. \nBut it didn't escape her that the little toy was bigger than she had been in a while, and had total freedom of movement. An ill-conceived escape ettempt was inevitable, so Paige preempted it by slamming her free hand down on the woman's chest, pinning her to the mattress.\nShe could hear the other woman's shout of surprise and pain, and tried to ignore her tiny hands grappling helplessly against her giant fingers. If she realized, maybe, that her struggles almost felt like bugs crawling on Paige's skin, she might be a little more careful. Paige's grin widened at the little woman's helplessness.\nShe grabbed the bullet part of the vibrator with her other hand, barely an inch tall, and held it between thumb and forefinger for the tiny woman to see. \"Look at this!\" she said cheerfully. \"I got this special for you to enjoy. You tried to pleasure me, and that's good, but you failed.\"\nShe licked the vibrator, covering the silicone with a thick, glistening layer of her spit, \"You're not that great, but this should keep you squirming.\" She leaned forward, until she could tell from Becca's expression that her face consumed the tiny woman's entire world. \"I like it when they squirm.\"\nShe pulled back, and shifted the hand holding down the shrunken toy so that she held her down by the waist, and used her thumb and forefinger to push her tiny thighs apart. At two feet in size, though, her legs competed in strength against Paige's fingers, and it took enough effort that she had to say aloud, \"It will be worse if you fight it.\"\nThat got her to calm down, at least a bit. Paige took the bullet vibrator and slowly shoved it into the tiny woman's vagina. She saw Becca's eyes widen and heard her shocked exhale; the vibrator was smaller than a tampon at her size, something that no woman would think twice about putting inside herself, but it was the shock of the unwilling violation. Paige could empathize, but that was the whole point.\nWith the vibrator safely inserted, only the cord still visible, Paige let go of Becca's legs, and they snapped reflexively together. She tried to twist away, but Paige still held a firm grip on her waist. \"Ah, ah, ah, we're not done,\" she said, placing another finger pointedly on the size slider.\nThis time, she heard the tiny woman speak. \"Please, no,\" she begged.\nPaige shook her head. \"You lost your vote when you failed to do your job,\" she told the little toy. \"This ends when I want it to.\"\nWith that, she shrank the woman almost instantly down to four inches, a comfortable size for her to stow in her vagina. Becca, who felt a tampon-sized object seemingly grow to be a foot long, and wider around than her wrist, collapsed into the bed, her eyes rolling back and her mouth falling open. Paige could clearly see the bulge of the vibrator inside her, stretching all the way to her belly button, and still a little bit of it stuck outside of her after the shrinking.\nShe chuckled, and placed a single, delicate finger on the part that was sticking out. Becca squirmed helplessly under her grip, and she shoved the vibrator all the way in. \nThe shrunken woman let loose a choked scream, audible even despite her size. Paige just shook her head, \"Oh, you poor girl,\" she said aloud. \"You have no idea what you're in for.\"\nBecca was already writhing helplessly, trapped in the throes of pleasure. That kind of penetration was not something that every woman could handle, and even the ones that could handle it could only do so after plenty of preparation. What Paige did to her should have split her open like an overcooked hot dog, but the invulnerability that came with the shrinking opened up so many possibilities. \nJust like what she had done with the Bad Dragon dildo, Becca would be forced to experience penetration far beyond her body's capacity, for as long as Paige felt was necessary. But, unlike her playtime with the Bad Dragon toy, it wouldn't just last until Paige came. Honestly, even with how violently the girl was squirming, Paige might not even reach orgasm; she was pretty good at suppressing it unless she wanted it.\nShe scooped the tiny, writhing figure up from the bed and, lifting one of her feet up onto the mattress, slowly slid her head-first into her vagina. A pleasured exhale escaped her lips, her pussy still too sensitive from the good fucking her boyfriend had delivered earlier. \nWhen the woman was safely nestled away, hidden head to toe inside Paige's body, the giantess lowered her foot to the ground and lifted up the vibrator's controller, held by a narrow wire to the tiny, living toy inside her. Her finger lingered on the button for a moment, thinking about what it was like for Becca right now. She had been in the tiny woman's position before, and, to be honest, she kind of envied her.\n\"Well,\" she said to herself, \"It's bettter than the horse.\"\nShe turned the vibrator on.\n \n","The unbearable heat, the suffocating pressure, the slimy taste of lubricant sliding down her throat, all of it was a distant footnote to the fog of pleasure that held Becca's mind and body captive. Her entire body flexed, hips rolling unbidden, limps thrashing helplessly as pure sexual ecstasy overwhelmed her.\nShe was vaguely aware of her screams, lost to the infinite tons of flesh that surrounded her. Salty bodily fluids flooded her lungs with every inhale, but she couldn't help herself; her body demanded that she vocalize her pleasure.\nThe orgasm seemed almost constant, no opportunity to recover from the last climax before the next crashed down on her. The vibration inside her was powerful, it shook her bones, and the feeling was beyond description. Just a few seconds, squeezing it as hard as she could, fighting back the climax with all her might, and she came with a desperate, choking shout. The wash of pleasure blinded out the world for a brief moment, and she almost forgot where she was. Then, just as her senses started to recover, she felt her body building towards another orgasm.\nIt was hell. It was heaven. A distant, lucid part of her brain knew where she was and what was happening to her, and was disgusted by it, but the rest of her body responded with limitless desire. She was a slave to her basest instincts, and they demanded that she follow the same rythm: fight the overwhelming stimulation with everything you have, then savor the inevitable orgasm.\nThen, suddenly, it was all over. The vibration stopped. She lay in the giantess' vagina, twitching helplessly as her heartbeat slowly stopped pounding in her ears. The sheer bulk of the vibrator inside her was still entirely too much, but it was at least something she could handle. As her senses recovered, sudden and diminishing waves of pleasure causing her entire body to shake, she tried to take stock of where she was, and how long it had been.\nHow many times had she orgasmed? A hundred? A thousand? It was all just a formless fog of ecstasy in her memory. Every muscle in her body was sore, her nipples almost painfully tender. She had a tendancy to squeeze them as she rode the ride to climax, but that muscle memory wasn't meant to last for this long. How long it was, though, she couldn't tell.\nShe was lying sideways, that much she knew. As she slowly regained control of her senses, she realized that Paige's heartbeat, each pulse slightly vibrating the elastic walls that wrapped around her body, was remarkably slow. So the woman was asleep. It had been at least the entire rest of the day. An entire day of thrashing around that violently, and the giantess hadn't even noticed? She had fallen asleep with a toy writhing around inside her?\nNo, not a toy. Becca had to correct her first thought. She wasn't a toy, she was an unwilling slave. At least this experience brought the end of her month of slavery that much closer, she thought. It had to have been days at this point, there was no way that this could have been the first time that Paige fell asleep with Becca inside her.\nA small part of her kind of missed it, though. Just forget about the world and let sexual pleasure overcome you, lifted to impossible heights of ecstasy by the immunity offered by the shrinking process. But, no, she wasn't a sex toy. She had dreams, an education, goals in life. At least she got something out of her time spent with Holly and Paige and whatever other sexual deviant they felt like sharing her with, but she would never let herself want to come back.\nHer body still nagged at her, though, as she lay there. Boredom inside the motionless body of a sleeping woman, and the subtle demands of a sex drive that had gotten used to constant climax, and she found herself with her hands between her legs, slowly massaging her clit. \nThe vibrator inside her was so large that she could feel its shape as she ran her hand over her belly. The unyielding pressure of that constant penetration, combined with the extra stimulation of a self-massage, was enough. She came once, on her own terms, her lungs pumping hot lubricant in and out of her body as she gasped in pleasure.\nThen, without warning, her position changed. She went from lying on her side to sticking straight up, and she realized immediately that the giantess had woken up. Maybe after a nap, maybe for a midniught piss, maybe for the day, she had no way of knowing. All she knew was the rhythmic shaking of the massive woman's hips, the quiet thudding of her foot against the floor. Her heartbeat rose as her body started to move around.\nThen she stopped. Becca waited, desperate for clues as to what the woman was up to. Would she hear a stream of urine through the walls? Would she feel her wriggle her way into a pair of pants? There was no way to know, and, to be honest, she was more curious about it than resentful. After all that time living in the throes of limitless orgasm, what did this giantess have planned for her next?\nSuddenly, the vibration turned back on, and Becca let loose a raw scream.\n The battery died overnight, like Paige had expected. She woke up the next morning to a powerful need to pee, and a toy who had stopped struggling inside her. She yawned, sliding a hand under the waistband of her sweatpants to scratch her ass. \"Was it good for you?\" she asked the tiny woman, still trapped in her vagina, speaking in the quietest whisper. Her question was barely vocal, asking more for her own amusement than anything else; she didn't want to wake her boyfriend, who still slept next to her.\nWell, first things first. A few brief periods of orgasm denial were part of the process, but the shrunken woman would build up resentment if left alone for too long. Paige climbed carefully out of bed, trying not to disturb her boyfriend, and made her way to the kitchen. She walked carefully on the balls of her feet, trying to keep from making too much noise, as she looked for where they kept the AA batteries.\nProbably should have done this before the batteries died, she thought. She finally produced a fresh pair from the junk drawer, and dug out another two before slamming the drawer shut and pulling the controller from the pocket of her sweatpants. \n\"Hope you enjoyed the time off,\" she said aloud as she popped the old, dead batteries out of the controller and placed the new ones in. \"Because it's back to work for you, bitch.\"\nShe turned the vibrator on. She could barely feel the vibration, but she could feel the tiny woman's response almost immediately. Becca's entire body spasmed the moment she hit the switch, and she started to squirm against the flesh that enveloped her. One of her tiny limbs pawed against her G-spot, and Paige let out a little moan. But, after rubbing her legs together and shifting her hips a bit, the shrunken woman's struggles moved away from the more sensitive areas, shifting from pleasurable to mildly enjoyable.\n\"There we go,\" she muttered, putting the controller back in her pocket and making her way to the bathroom. She could feel Becca's writhing with remarkable sensitivity, and she knew that every move the tiny woman made was purely involuntary. Even so, at her size, she didn't have the power to make Paige lose control. For the next few days, the added stimulation would just make her a little happier and a little hornier.\nShe had been in this tiny woman's position before. She had been an involuntary recruit, and this exact same process had turned her into a willing employee, one of the company's best. She wondered if the tiny girl had any idea how absolutely meaningless her full-body struggles were.\nFive days. That was enough for almost any woman. Paige would tack on another two to cover Becca's experience with Holly. Her roommate was a fantastic toy, but she had no idea how to train a new employee. Her brief playtime with the shrunken woman had probably baked in a lot of extra resistance to the concept as a whole, but an extra two days spent in the throes of limitless pleasure would likely solve that problem.  Paige carried about her morning routine with a sultry smile. She could go anywhere she liked, and there would be a tiny woman buried head-to-toe inside her who was slave to an endless train of orgasms. Nobody would ever know, and that was the kind of power that made her happy.\n","Becca struggled constantly to keep her grip on her senses, to maintain her view on what was going on in the world around her, even if it was just the pulsing, lubricant-soaked interior of the giantess' vagina. But pure, electric pleasure assaulted her entire body, and it was impossible to maintain her focus.\nShe had brief, exhausted moments of lucidity, but they were short-lived. A sudden, violent wave of orgasm would take control of her entire body, and she would be blind to both space and time until she recovered, seemingly hours later. And, even then, a relentless, pulsing force of unrelenting pleasure quickly stole away her senses, She kicked, she squirmed, she screamed, but nothing could stop the constant pressure of ecstasy that seemed to push in from every direction.\nFocus, girl. Focus. It's your body, take control, push it back, just... Oh, FUCK!\nHer legs twisted together, her back arcing as another orgasm seized her entire body. She fought it, clenching her fists and grinding her teeth, but her body's imperative wouldn't be denied. When she regained control, she let loose a frustrated scream. Come on! Get control of yourself! You're a person, not a sex toy!\nShe reached between her legs and tugged on the cord, but even that tiny motion of the vibrator inside her sent a spike of pleasure through her body. She suppressed it as best she could, focusing on her anger at how Holly, and now Paige had treated her, stoking her fury to keep the pleasure at bay. It worked, just barely, but the relentless vibration built up the ecstasy until it would not be denied. Her vision blurred with tears, her fingernails digging into her palms, as another climax sent every limb quivering like she was posessed.\nBy the time her senses recovered, her whole body shook with sobs. \"Please, stop,\" she begged, to the giantess, to nobody, to her own body. \"Please... Just... Oh! Oh, fuck!\"\nAnother orgasm hit her, and it hit her hard. Her right hand shot unbidden to her breast, pinching at her nipple, at she hated herself for it. By the time she managed to pull her hand away from her tender nipples, the orgasm had already passed.\nChrist, how much more of this? Did she even have a choice here? She had always thought her orgasms were purely mental, that she had to put herself in the right place to finish. But she couldn't push this unadulterated pleasure back even if she tried. What was wrong with her?\nAnother climax hit her. Both her hands were on her breasts immediately, twisting her nipples hard, mixing the tiniest bit of pain into the seemingly limitless pleasure. Every muscle from head to toe tightened, and she couldn't breathe deep enough to let out the scream that her body demanded of her.\nDon't fight it. \nShe thrashed in the throes of climax. Who said that? The words were crystal clear, but they seemed to come from everywhere. With the tons of flesh surrounding her, it couldn't have been the giantess, not and still sound that clear, so who was it? Did she even recognize that voice? Was it her own voice? Was it her mind?\nShe fought the rising pleasure with only a token effort, letting the ceaseless vibration push her into the next climax. In that moment, she went briefly blind to the heat, the pressure, the seemingly endless field of pink of the giantess' vagina.\nEnjoy it.\nOhhhhhhh.... fuck..... She came to, briefly, with one leg at an odd position. She had kicked, rather forcefully, without even intending to. The elastic flesh that surrounded her body had absorbed the motion like quicksand, but the vibrator's cable had tangled around her leg. She didn't have time to right herself as the pleasure built again, and her entire body was seized in the grip of orgasm.\nYou can't escape it. It'll be worse if you fight it.\nThat voice... She didn't know where it came from, but it was right. How long had she been fighting these orgasms? A minute? A day? A year? She was immortal; tender nipples, sore vagina, none of it mattered. All that measured was the pleasure, and the brief trips to normalcy that she made between climaxes. She could handle that, couldn't she?\nAnother orgasm grabbed control of her body, and she didn't fight it this time; she felt a scream rip its way from her throat, but she didn't care.\n \n \n Paige left the little girl to her own devices, and carried on about her life as if she wasn't even there. Becca continued struggling, stronger and more resiliant than she expected, ignoring very pointed contractions of Paige's pelvic muscles, but the larger woman could suppress the pleasure of the constant stimulation.\nAt least, she thought she could. But, when she slept, she could barely stay down for three hours before she jolted awake with a pleasured gasp, all her muscles sore and her crotch soaking wet. She had come in her sleep, she was sure of it. She changed her soiled underwear and lay back down on her back, hoping that the extra pressure would calm the girl down, but it still took more than an hour for her to fall back asleep.\nShe awoke again, an hour before her alarm, with her chest heaving and a massive wet stain in her panties. Fuck, she had climaxed again in her sleep. She used to be able to sleep through the night with a squirming toy inside her; either this tiny girl was especially lucky, or she was getting rusty.\n\"I hope you're happy,\" she said aloud, rolling out of bed with a groan. No falling back asleep now, might as well get an early start on the morning routine.\nHer underwear, the second pair of the night, she noted, were already ruined, so she masturbated in the kitchen as she waited for the coffee to brew. The tiny girl's thrashing inside her body helped her along quite a bit, and she fell against the counter, gripping the edge with white knuckles.\nAs her bare chest heaved; she rarely slept with a bra on; it did occur to her that she had come twice overnight, and she still felt compelled to seek release. Was this tiny woman inside her going to keep her this horny the whole time? She could handle that, but it definitely would get messy.\nShe could still feel Becca inside her, her limbs thrashing about involuntarily amidst the throes of limitless pleasure. She envied the tiny girl a bit, but, though her memories of days spent lost in ceaseless bliss made her warm inside and put a naughty half-smile on her face, they probably didn't help keep her sex drive at bay.\nFuck, this was going to be annoying. Sure, it was going to be frustrating to put up with the constant stimulation when she had shit to do, but, even worse, the only real release she could get was rubbing herself off. Still bleary-eyed from having just woken up, she had already been horny enough to masturbate once, and, despite that, all she wanted to do was dive back into bed and wake her boyfriend up by wrapping her thighs around his head.\nHoly shit. When she had properly broken this girl, she was going to do terrible things to her. She'd teach her everything she knew in twenty-four hours. She'd spend an entire day in bed with her boyfriend, and take every hour, from morning to night, to show Becca everything there was to know about her new job.\n \n","Becca was completely lost to a fog of pleasure, floating along in seemingly permanent ecstasy. She was only vaguely aware of the oppressive heat of her surroundings, or of the desperate thrashing of her own body. The orgasms came one after the other, over and over again, so rapid that she just didn't have the time to handle any of her other senses.\nOccasionally, she would break the surface of lucidity with a brief pause in the vibration. She could feel the soreness in every limb, the raw feeling in her throat from her ceaseless screams. Her heartbeat pounded in her ears, louder than the steady thump-thumping of the giantess' heartbeat that permeated the walls around her. In those brief moments, she remembered who she was, and her very first, instinctual response was resentment. She didn't want to know who she was, she just wanted to return to that land of ecstasy.\nShe wanted more. She tried to bring her hands between her legs to do the job herself, but she couldn't. Her pussy was so, so sensitive; she could barely touch her clit without her entire body heaving. Her pelvic muscles screamed in exhaustion, a deep ache in a part of her body that had never felt sore before. Her entire body begged for relief, but her mind wanted nothing but to return to that place of bliss. Maybe, given more time, she would have recognized that desire as a weird, lascivious twist to Stockholm syndrome, and learned to overcome it. But she didn't really have the opportunity to think past her body's first, hormone-fuelled desires; not long after she had regained the mental capacity to wonder why she had fallen from heaven, the vibrator kicked back in to full strength and brought her right back.\nWhen the vibration started again, the brief minutes of deprivation made it seem so much stronger. Within a few seconds, she returned to near-continuous climax. Her entire body shook, and she screamed in desperation, but there was no reprieve.\nShe started to enjoy it, or even to expect it. At the very least, she started to view the occasional breaks as nothing more than well-deserved breathers. She savored the opportunity to take those deep, exhausted breaths of relief, laden down with hot vaginal fluids as they were, but could only pray that the pleasure would return before her senses came back to full capacity, delivering a much-delayed punishment for the abuse and neglect that they had suffered over the past... How long had it been? Hours? Days? Weeks?\nHonestly, it could very well have been months. Paige could have left her here as a living tampon, sucking down bright red period blood like air, and she really wouldn't have cared. In fact, the thought that Paige would let her remain in this limitless world of sexual ecstasy even throughout the inconvenience of menstruation seemed like a kindness. After all, she probably didn't make for a very good tampon.\nHowever long it had been, Becca was growing increasingly confident that it would last forever. It was really all she could ever want. This sexual pleasure was the most pure, most visceral experience she could ever hope for, and it was completely unceasing. She never wanted for food or water, and her nauseasting, claustrophic surroundings were barely an afterthought to her. What could be better?\nThen, suddenly, the vibration cut short for the last time. It took a minute, every muscle from head to toe twitching uncontrollably, residual pleasure plucking at the strings of her body, for her to even realize that it had happened. \nMuscle memory seemed to expect a return to the unending pleasure any moment now, and her body seemed to periodically prepare for it. Her entire body would tense all at once and without warning. Her hands began to twitch, seeking out the sensitive flesh of her nipples. After a few minutes, one of her hands began to find its way between her legs, but the flesh there was so raw that it drew back immediately in a sudden shock of pained pleasure.\nEventually, her ecstasty-addled mind began to wonder. Was it over? Her senses slowly recovered, the overwhelming stench of the giantess' vagina hitting her first, the heat that enveloped her body coming second. Time crawled along, and she slowly regained control of herself; the vibration should have kicked back in by now, she thought. She shouldn't be deprived of pleasure for this long. Had she done something wrong?\nThe vibrator was still inside her; she moved her hands to her belly and felt the distinct lump there. But, at this point, the sheer bulk of it just felt normal. She wanted to go back, to feel that limitless pleasure, but she didn't dare bring her hands between her legs. Her pussy was excruciatingly sore, throbbing pulses of pain washing across her body with every heartbeat. Touching that sensitive flesh would be more painful than she could handle.\nShe was exhausted. Every muscle in her body cried for relief, and her pelvic muscles seemed to be the focus for it all. She could barely twitch around the bulk of the vibrator inside her without tears welling up in her eyes. \nChrist, the giantess had really done a number on her tiny body. But, even so, all she really wanted was for that vibration to kick back in. Sore muscles and sensitive flesh be damned, she wanted to return to that place of endless orgasm. But she couldn't do it on her own; Paige controlled the vibrator, and that was the only thing that would overcome her body's limitations and return her to infinite pleasure.\nThen, suddenly, Becca felt the giantess' fingers on her feet. She let out a yelp of surprise, but it happened too quick. A rush of pink flesh, a blast of cold air, and she found herself sprawled out on top of silky bedsheets. A thin wire led from between her legs to Paige's fist, still hanging loose, at least for now.\nBecca took a breath, then doubled over in a coughing fit. Her lungs were full of sticky lubricant, and her body, desperate for air, demanded to expel it. After a minute of violent coughing, she finally recovered, the bedcloth below her stained with the giantess' fluids. She looked up at the massive woman, a little ashamed of what she had done, but still well aware of the fact that her entire body, from head to toe, was still coated in lubricant; she was still a sex toy, and she had no illusions about that fact.\nPaige looked down at her impassively, waiting for her to recover. The giantess sat on the bed, her dark brown legs raised high above, and Becca sat only a few feet away from her crotch. It was a dangerous place to be, she knew. She could imagine a sudden hand on her back forcing her headfirst into that wet, fleshy slit, but, to her surprise, the thought wasn't entirely disgusting. If anything, the mental image sent a warmth between her own legs. \nWhen Becca had finally calmed down, gulping down fresh air like a drowning sailor, Paige leaned forward a bit, brandishing the vibrator's remote like a sword. \"Oh, Becca, I'm so happy you're back.\"\nHer hand came down with terrifying speed, slamming her back into the bed. For a moment, she thought that Paige was about to pick her up, then she pushed down even harder, and she felt the vibrator inside her start to move.\nShe screamed. Good God, no... It was too big... But her palm pushed down, and she felt the massive bulk of the vibrator start to slide out of her body. \nOhhhhh.... Fuck! Her entire body squirmed, kicking and punching against the overwhelming sensation. Her breath came quick and desperate, and she was about to let loose another scream, then it suddenly ended.\nThe vibrator came loose from her body, and Paige lifted it up, depositing it in the same hand that held the remote. Becca's chest heaved, her body completely overwhelmed by the incredibly powerful sensation of her body emptying so profoundly. Her vision was filled with stars, but, as it slowly recovered, she noticed the giantess' massive face looming over her.\n\"Did you have fun?\" Paige asked.\nBecca barely had the presence of mind to realize she had been asked a question. But, after a few seconds of grasping, she finally met the massive woman's eyes and gave her a brief, exhausted nod.\nPaige's face split into a wide grin. \"That's good!\" she said. \"Do you know how long it's been?\"\nBecca had to think about it for a moment, slowly pulling herself to her feet; she had vague memories of having contemplated how much time had passed, but no real frame of reference for what was going on outside her nearly-endless world of sexual pleasure. Eventually, she was forced to shake her head. \"No,\" she said, although she wasn't sure that Paige would hear her at this size.\n\"It's been nine days.\"\nHoly shit.\n\"I know that doesn't seem like much,\" Paige continued, her voice growing husky, \"But I bet it felt like a lot longer.\"\nPaige breathed deeply in through her nose, and then let it out as a heavy, almost moaning sigh, dropping the vibrator and the remote off to the side. Becca could feel the wind of her exhalation like a hurricane. The force of it nearly knocked her on her ass, but she managed to hold her ground. Then, in a voice so loud that it rivaled the thud-thud­ of the heartbeat that had pervaded her world barely a minute ago, she said, \"There are a lot of people who don't get to enjoy what you experienced, you know.\"\nPaige's right hand fell down to her crotch, and she ran her middle finger downwards between her labia. Slowly, so Emma could hear the wet sound of flesh on flesh, and see the dark brown walls part to reveal the bright pink underneath. She had to admit that the sight was a bit tantalizing, but she wasn't sure if she was comfortable about that fact yet.\nThe giantess paused at the bottom to quickly slide her finger knuckle-deep into her vagina. A soft, expectant exhalation accompanied the squelching of lubricant-soaked flesh, but Emma was distracted by just how deep the woman was able to get in there, and so effortlessly, too. \nPaige's finger was easily as tall as she was, if not taller, and she had just sunk it all the way to the hand into her own vagina, and then drew it out as if it was nothing. Becca couldn't shake the thought that being in there, surrounded by the other woman's warmth, and being actually lucid enough to enjoy the experience would be the hottest thing she could imagine. \nPaige pulled her finger slowly back upwards, tracing the same, slimy path up between her labia, and paused on her clitoris only to draw a lazy circle around it. \"Come on,\" she moaned, lust pouring over her words, \"Show me what you felt.\"\nBecca didn't even wait. She fell facefirst onto the woman's labia, pulling apart the fleshy walls with eager hands to clamp her mouth on the clitoris. She pushed away the probing finger, looking to do the job herself. She knew that her strength could never outclass the giantess', but Paige acquiesced anyway.\nBecca licked, sucked, and bit at the sensitive organ, doing whatever she could to make up for the fact that it was almost the size of her head. Her tiny body and its miniscule weight couldn't really make an impression even on the soft flesh between Paige's legs, and her arms started to tremble from the effort of holding the massive, pliant walls far enough apart that she could get at the juicy bits.\nPaige answered her unspoken weakness by placing her middle and forefingers on either side of her pussy and pulling the flesh apart. Her labia parted like the gates of heaven, and Becca dug into her task with a renewed will, bringing both her hands down to massage the parts that her mouth could not reach.\nMaybe she was just horny, but the way that the giantess could so effortlessly manipulate the world around her was so fucking hot. At any moment, Paige could take over and obliterate all her efforts, turn her into a living toy, and there would be no way to stop it. The idea was so erotic that she drew her hips hard up against the hot, wet flesh that presented itself in front of her. Fuck, she couldn't wait for that to happen.\nPaige didn't disappoint, either. After Becca maybe intentionally reduced the intensity of her clitoris massage, she felt the massive woman's fingers strike her back like a punch from a gorilla. In an instant, she was buried up to her hips in the warmth and pressure of the giantess' vagina. \nShe savored that view for a moment, a perspective that she had never really appreciated. The seemingly infinite expanse of the giantess' body, framed by the dark brown lips of her labia and the bright pink sliver of flesh that was hidden beneath. All she wanted was to be all the way inside her, her tiny form fully entrusted to Paige's gorgeous black body.\nShe got her wish barely a second later. She felt a finger on her head, and another on each of her shoulders, and, with the insistent pressure of a giantess, she sunk bodily into the muscular flesh of Paige's vagina.\n","    Paige knew, from the behavior of her tiny toy, that she had already succeeded in breaking the little woman. Little Becca would want nothing more than sexual excitement, and she would be happy to accept the vicarious reward of bringing her mistress to orgasm. Now she was in the test phase; if the shrunken girl was able to maintain that attitude for more than a few days, then the process was complete. If not, then Paige would have to shove the vibrator inside her for a few more days to stew in that enviable world of limitless pleasure.    She'd only ever had to do the second breaking phase once. She did not doubt that her new toy, or, to be more accurate, her new coworker, would capitulate after the first. This moment was when she tested that theory, where she introduced the woman to her new job and determined whether she was ready for it.    Becca didn't know it, but she was in the middle of the job interview of her life.    Paige pushed the tiny woman feetfirst into her vagina, then laid back on the bed, waiting to see what she would do. She had felt the sloppy struggles of a toy trying to escape, and she had felt the more deliberate motions of an amateurish prospective coworker trying to please her. She knew the difference, and now was the moment of truth for her aspiring new coworker.    Shortly after she laid back to wait, she felt something brush forcefully against her G-spot. She couldn't stop her entire body from tightening up, her hips rising slightly off the bed at the sudden pang of pleasure. She managed to hold back the moan, but fat load of good it did her with her subject buried inside her body.     Her body's involuntary response was clear as day to the shrunken woman, and Becca redoubled her efforts. Paige felt the surge of motion inside her, and tried to harden herself against it, but the little girl was too close to her most sensitive parts. Only seconds later, another wave of pleasure took control of her body, leaving her gasping for breath, her hips squirming around on the bed.    \"God, girl...\" she whispered, caught in ecstasy. Then there was another forceful push against her G-spot, and she uttered a curse through clenched teeth. She rolled onto her side, legs pressed together, both her hands pressed up against her crotch. She drew deep, desperate breaths, trying to hold back the building pleasure.    But the ceaselessly squirming toy inside her would not be denied. As she lay there, trying to regain control of herself, the shrunken woman shoved herself up against her G-spot, over and over and over again. Paige's gasps turned to screams as the pleasure built and built. Her entire body tightened up, straightening into a line, and she felt her pussy clench with a will around the living toy.    But there was no stopping it. Only seconds later, she came. Her body broke like a guitar string, her back arcing, toes curling, face contorted in pure pleasure. Every muscle from head to toe siezed up in the throes of orgasm, leaving her gasping desperately for breath that would not come.    She could have died in that moment and been happy, but it came to an end quickly. She heard herself, as if from outside her own body, moaning desperately in pleasure as she came down from the height of orgasm. Her body writhed around, her pelvic muscles clenching helplessly against the tiny woman inside her.    Finally, she regained control of her senses, and felt the tiny woman still struggling inside her pussy. In the afterglow of her climax, the stimulation was entirely too strong. Moaning in desperation, she spread her legs and slid her fingers into her vagina, seeking out the tiny woman. Even that little penetration was enough to make her gasp, but she couldn't stand one more moment of Becca's ceaseless writhing.    She managed to close her fingers around the tiny girl's torso, and dragged her out into daylight. She did it as slowly as she dared, but it still elicited a sensual gasp from her overstimulated body. You lucky bitch, she thought. You enjoyed this for a week, and I can barely stand it for ten minutes.    She was a wreck, and she knew that she couldn't afford to show herself, not in this state, not at this stage of the process. She dropped the woman onto the bed, then scooted forward, bowling her over under the muscular steamroller of her ass.    She felt the hard, struggling body of the shrunken woman under her right asscheek. She was happy with her there for now, but her time was limited. She wasn't a torturer, she was a teacher, so she had to make a lesson out of all of this.    Paige wiped her face and brushed back her hair, trying, in the few seconds she had, to make it look like she hadn't just experienced the orgasm of her life. No time for mirrors or selfies, she just had to trust that she had it right.    She scooted backwards, freeing Becca from underneath her ass, looked down at the tiny girl, and said, \"Hey, you did good!\"    The giantess' weight lifted off of Becca as abruptly as it had come crashing down on top of her. It had happened so quickly that she was almost sure that it had been an accident, but how could Paige forget about her? She had brought the giantess to an orgasm so powerful that she could feel it from within her pussy. And then she had just forgotten her underneath her ass?    Becca had done odd things in the wake of an orgasm, too, she supposed. Maybe Paige had her own weird quirks. She'd try not to read too much into it.    The giantess was an infinite wall of brown flesh. Becca lay, soaked in slimy vaginal fluids, between her thighs, themselves the size of redwood trees. She could see the smooth texture of her skin, the bumpy surface of her clean-shaven crotch, and the thin sliver of pink that protruded from between her labia. The whole mess of it was absolutely soaked in fluids, glistening and radiating heat from the sexual experience. She could even see the little spot of fluid on the back of the woman's thigh where she had rolled over Becca just a second ago.    She had been inside that barely a minute ago, but she couldn't help but see it as an inviting, warm embrace. A voice inside her told her to rush in and try to get deep, deep in there, but she knew that Paige had pulled her out for a reason. She didn't really want to invite any punishment from the massive woman.    The massive woman leaned forward, and Becca watched in admiration at her abdominal muscles flexing underneath the dark, slightly sweaty skin. She brushed ebony hair out of her face, her face noticably flushed, and smiled that smile of a woman pleased. \"Hey, you did good!\" she exclaimed.    Becca beamed, and wiped a drop of fluid off of her forehead, unconsciously mirroring Paige's motion. The giantess straightened up, looking down at her over the mound of her breasts, and continued. \"I think you've got what it takes, but I can't have you doing that all the time, okay? I've got to go to the store, do you want to come with?\"    Uncertain, but happy that the giantess was happy with her, Becca nodded. The massive woman let out a deep, pleasured sigh, the afterglow finally wearing off, then tossed her legs over the side of the bed and stood up.    To Becca, the motion was tremendous. Her train-sized legs flew over her head at an incredible speed, and then her titanic body sprang up off the bed, traveling hundreds of feet in an instant. With her weight removed, the bed sprang upwards, and Becca, partially distracted by watching the graceful, sinewy motions of the black giantess, lost her footing.    Paige went over to her closet, her ass flexing and jiggling with every step, and started digging out clothes. Without even looking back at Becca, she said, \"You decide how you want to go.\"    It took a second for her to realize what the woman meant, but the moment the first piece of clothing sailed over her shoulder and nearly struck Becca in the head, she realized.     A tight cotton t-shirt, a pair of pink ankle socks, grey boyshorts, a matching sports bra all flew at Becca in a few seconds, barely missing her. The black athletic pants that came last actually did hit her, and she had to spend a minute getting out from underneath them.     She noticed, as she struggled from underneath the soft fabric, shedding most of the lubricant that was still on her body, that the pants had pockets on the side. Nice.    When she emerged, she saw Paige standing over her, still naked, her hands on her hips. \"This is part of it,\" she explained. \"It's not all sex, all the time. A lot of time you just have to wait. You don't always get the choice of where, though.\"    Becca looked at the clothes scattered around her, realizing the breadth of her options. She could spend the rest of the day against any part of Paige's body that she wanted, on one side of the fabric or the other. None of the clothes seemed like they would offer her much room to move around, so she'd have to pick a comfortable spot.    She entertained the idea of making it about sex and picking the center of the woman's panties. The heat and the smell permeating her entire life, lying in a position of control where she could, if not actively try to bring the woman to orgasm, at least keep her hot and bothered. But, like Paige had said, it wasn't all sex, all the time. Trying to make it that way might bother her and actually turn her off.    Her eyes scanned up and down the giantess' body, trying to imagine being up against every part of it. Pressed into the silky smooth dark flesh, absorbing the heat and the scent of her. Did she want to be in facefirst or get the chance to see the thin shadow of the world through the fabric?    She ultimately walked over to the boyshorts and stood in the middle of them. \"Really?\" Paige asked her, crossing her arms over her chest.    Becca nodded, \"Right on your ass,\" she said, slapping her right buttcheek in case her tiny voice didn't carry to the massive woman.    Paige nodded. \"You got it,\" she said. She grabbed the panties off the bed and slid them on, eyeing the shrunken woman with a sultry smile. With a snap of the waistband, she tightened the underwear against the curve of her body, the crotch darkening slightly as it absorbed the fluids from her pussy. Then she picked Becca up off the bed, holding her upside-down by the ankles.    Becca was moved at a dizzying speed across a seemingly impossible distance. She wasn't really able to get her bearings until she was looking down along the curve of the woman's back, staring down at the waistband that Paige had pulled open with her offhand. She realized with a start that the giantess wasn't going to be careful about where she put her; she was holding her waistband open by the center, and the only thing Becca could see was the crack of her ass. That was not where she wanted to be.    No time to struggle, though. The giantess let go and Becca tumbled facefirst down into her panties. She bounced once off the springy flesh of her ass, sprang back off the elastic of the panties, and wound up nestled upside-down right underneath the curve of the woman's left buttcheek, a body length above where her butt met her leg, and just outside of arm's reach of the crack of her ass.    She managed to twist herself around so that she was facing outwards just before Paige let go of the waistband. The grey elastic fabric rushed at her immediately, wrapping around her with a snap and pressing her relentlessly into the soft, muscular flesh at her back. If the giantess had been wearing a thong, she wouldn't have been covered, but she was close enough to the danger zone, or so to speak, that a pair of cheeky underwear would have caught her.    She could see the world relatively clearly, though upside-down, through the fabric. It squeezed against her even harder as the giantess leaned forward, and then she pulled up the athletic pants. The extra layer of fabric darkened her view enough that she could only make out shapes, and the form fit pressed her even tighter into the giantess' ass, sealing her prison.\n","    When Paige was fully dressed, she gave her little panty pet a playful slap before she stepped out the door. When she checked in the mirror, she saw that the tiny woman was printing pretty clearly through the fabric of her pants. Not so clearly that you could make out the shape of her body, but clearly enough that anyone who cared to look would realize that something was in her pants. Anyone who knew what she did would know what it was, so she decided to own it and changed into one of her XMart t-shirts. Put in a little advertising, and, if she was lucky, she'd leave the grocery store with a prospective client along with a prospective coworker.    Becca had far exceeded her expectations. For even the most eager women, that first moment when Paige called them to prove themselves from inside her body was an awkward, halting experience. Even the ones with the most promise weren't really sure what to do with themselves, but they gave it an honest effort, and she knew what that felt like. She had expected, at best, a clumsy, blind pawing at the inside of her pussy, not enough to bring her to orgasm by itself, but enough to intensify an orgasm she made happen on her own.    But what she did not expect was the shrunken woman eagerly digging in and driving directly into her g-spot. She did not expect Becca, barely five inches tall, to be even remotely capable of bringing her to orgasm. She did not expect a new prospective coworker, barely minutes after emerging from the 'breaking' phase, to dive so eagerly into her role as a sex toy. The tiny woman had given her an orgasm so intense that it made her wonder why she bothered wasting her time with men.     Becca's attitude could change in the coming days, so she had to carry forwards with the plan, but, right now, she couldn't dare allow the shrunken woman the opportunity to stimulate her the way she had before. She had offered a place for Becca to stay, but she had no intention of obeying her wishes if she had selected somewhere that could cause Paige to lose control. When Becca had chosen a spot in Paige's ass, she was relieved; no need to fight back an orgasm for the next few hours, and no need to seem unnecessarily cruel.    Her careless placement of the shrunken girl had been more of a lesson than it was explicit cruelty. In her experience, no matter how accommodating your clients were, they did not appreciate how significant the smallest movements of their body could be to a person so small. In that spirit, she had tried to put the tiny girl where she had asked, but hadn't been careful to ensure it was exactly where she had indicated.    But she still expected the girl to select something a bit less... torturous. She was more than familiar with sexual intimacy, so a spot in Paige's panties or in the cup of her bra was an easy choice. But choosing to live in any location that would subject her to the massive weight of Paige's body was a sign of pure masochism. The only place she could think of that would be worse than the one Becca had chosen would be inside her shoe.    But she couldn't judge her new prospective coworker for her kinks. She just had to sit back and watch them manifest; if they got nasty, she could intervene, but, given her career field, the standard for what was acceptable was pretty low, occasionally even treading the line of what was legal. The worst that could happen was that she'd have to turn the training over to someone who could handle the shrunken woman's fetishes.    Given how Becca had responded so far, that was unlikely. She still had a few more weeks with the woman, but Paige had the impression that she would be more of a willing participant for the remaining time. She could hand her back off to Holly after she had proven herself. Maybe, if she did really good, Paige could even let her go early.    The prisoner in her underwear didn't struggle much under her weight as she sat in her car on the ride to the store, only responding weakly when Paige wriggled around playfully in the seat. She was a patient passenger as well when Paige was up and walking around, almost to the point that she forgot about the shunken toy.    Almost. Every eye that she caught glancing at her ass was a reminder, a little exhibitionist thrill, and the look of recognition in a few faces when they saw the XMart logo on her shirt was even better. They may not necessarily have known what was going on, but they certainly knew what she did for a living.     There was not universal approval; the most judging looks she got were from the other women, in fact. It didn't bother her that much, not with the knowledge that many of these women were the same ones who would recruit her services. Men, on the other hand, largely did not seem to notice or care.     Except the one who grabbed her ass in the dairy aisle. He got a good grip, too, the kind she wouldn't even tolerate in public from her boyfriend. Paige jumped away and around, outrage burning on her face, in time to see the look of confusion on his, then the horror of realization as his eyes glanced down to her shirt.    He looked like a typical fraternity guy, almost to the point of being a cartoonish stereotype, complete with boat shoes. It tickled her to see him recoil like that. She smacked his hand aside, although he had already pulled it back, and yelled, \"Don't fucking touch me, perv!\"         He muttered his apology and retreated, disappearing around the corner. Paige was still furious, but she had to admit it was funny. Becca had chosen that spot of her own volition, but it had completely creeped out a creeper. He had run from her as if she was a witch and was about to shrink him down too. She kinda wished she had that power in that moment; leave an empty pile of clothes in the middle of the store and take home a new toy that she, Holly, and Becca could all entertain themselves with.    The fabric of her pants was sheer enough that, even though nobody could see in, Becca could probably see out. She wondered what the tiny girl thought of the encounter from her perspective.    The crushing weight and suffocating heat of the giantess' body, in the thirty minute or so car ride to the store, made Becca start to regret her choice of position. But, when Paige finally stood up and started walking around, she had to admit that she enjoyed it. The gentle, swinging motion of her step, followed by the hard impact of her foot and the flexing of the massive muscle at her back. The way her view of the world rose up and down with the massive woman's gait. The almost-rhythm of it was practically soothing.    The other part was the thrill of it. Though the motion was a bit disorienting, and being stuck upside-down didn't help at all, she got to be a passive witness to the routine of the giantess' life, from one of the most intimate parts of her body. The brighter light of day made it easier to see than in the dim confines of her bedroom, so she was clearly able to see where she was and what was happening.    The first thing she noticed was the sheer number of people who looked at Paige's ass. Becca had felt those eyes herself, and she knew that Paige was a beautiful, sexy woman, but she had no idea how bad it was. Everyone, man or woman, took at least a glance when her back was turned, and more than a few let their eyes linger to observe the swing and bounce of her step, the ride that Becca got to experience firsthand.     She wasn't sure how obvious her position was from the outside, so maybe they were seeing her. She wondered what would happen if she gave them a wave when they looked. But it was more entertaining for her to consider herself invisible, a living, breathing, seeing part of this gorgeous woman's ass.    She saw the frat guy, the fixated way he ogled Paige's backside, and the intent in his step from clear across the aisle. She knew exactly what was going to happen, but couldn't do anything but lie there and watch it.     His hand grabbed Paige's ass, fingers cupping Becca's little hiding spot, and, the gall of it, he actually squeezed. There was no way he didn't feel her there. Paige's reaction was dizzying in its speed, jumping away from the man's grip so violently that Becca actually slid a bit down the inside of her underwear.     Damn, girl. She could empathize with her furious reaction, but Becca kind of enjoyed it. It was a doubling-down of the sensuality, the subtle exhibitionism of her position. It was one thing to experience sexual assault in an innocent setting here, but what she wouldn't do to be in the same position when Paige spent a night at the club.     By the time Paige turned her back on the man again, he was long gone, clearly scared off by her violent reaction. Becca couldn't help but feel a sense of loss, even though she knew what the guy had done was wrong on so many levels. She wanted the whole world to know where she was, and she wanted them to be jealous.    The giantess returned to the routine of grocery shopping, and Becca returned to savoring the almost-rhythm of her gait. Step-flex, step-flex, step-flex. Pause, flex, step, flex, pause. Step-flex, step-flex, pause. From where she lay, there was no way for her to know what was coming next, and that was just part of the erotic excitement of it.    'Erotic' may not have been the right word. She was in an exciting place, and there was no denying the thrill of the voyeurism, but it didn't make her horny. If she tried hard enough, she could probably masturbate here, but she didn't really feel the need to. She just enjoyed the closeness, the intimacy of being effectively a part of Paige's massive body.    But she wouldn't object if the giantess decided to start masturbating. Either on her own or using Becca as a living dildo, it didn't matter to her. She just wanted to see her mistress be happy.    Mistress?     She wasn't a slave, was she?     Why did she think of Paige as her mistress, then?\n","    Paige remained bothered by the jerk who had grabbed her ass in  the supermarket for far longer than she should have. She knew that she  should have forgotten about it already, but she couldn't. She made a  livelihood of accepting, of being a part of strangers' sexual kinks. She  had been inside more people, both men and women, than she could count.  There was no call for her to be offended this deeply, especially after  she had sent the man scurrying away.\n    She decided to chalk it  up to the fact that she wasn't in 'work mode,' or so to speak. She knew  already that her job required a different mindset than the  in-the-bedroom, curtains-drawn 'in the mood.' It wasn't an eagerness to  explore new things for sexual gratification, it was a willingness to  accept whatever happened to her, and a presence of mind to guide an  uncertain customer along. But, while blissfully living her own life, she  was nowhere near that kind of mindset.     If anything, with  Becca riding in her panties, she was in the opposite mode. She was in  power, the goddess who had another person under her total control. It  was a position she rarely was able to enjoy, and that anonymous asshole  had come along to rudely remind her that, no matter what she did, she  was still a woman in a man's world.    Her first impulse was to  take her frustration out on Becca, trying to find a way to blame her,  and her conspicuous spot in the seat of her pants, for what had  happened. But she knew, deep down, that the shrunken woman couldn't be  blamed for the inexcusable actions of an anonymous pervert any more than  Paige herself could. Punishing Becca for it would only be  counterproductive, especially since she was, notionally, trying to train  her to be a willing employee of X-Mart.        Paige knew that,  if she wanted to groom a new colleague, punishment was not the thing  that she needed right now. At this stage, she needed reinforcement.  Empowerment. Becca needed to learn that pleasing her giantess, being  ready to fulfill her every whim, was a good thing, and rewards would  follow from doing so. For Paige, the rewards were strictly monetary, but  her experience had shown that the promise of a paycheck did nothing for  prospective new employees.     She tried her best to put it out  of her mind on the ride home, seeking to recover her sense of  domination by enjoying the feeling of the shrunken woman trapped under  her ass as she drove. It worked. Mostly.    The rest of the day was uneventful. Paige rarely interacted with Becca,  no sexual torture or humiliating punishment, barely even a passing  word. That was deliberate. It was part of the lesson that, with rare  exceptions, a good amount of time the job would be spent not really  doing the job. More importantly, it helped to normalize an objectively  extreme existance. Deprive the trainee of a normal person's reality, and  they learn to accept their new reality.    This was crucially  important. She had to accept that her life as a shrunken sex slave was  normal, or it would all come crashing down. This being a college town,  the more brutal parts of the job were much more common. The Greek houses  often put in long contracts that could be very demanding, much like the  one that Holly had been on before Becca so clumsily hijacked it. Even  better, there were plenty of bars and concerts with Bacchanalian revelry  in the back room that would be a long, noisy, and fluid-filled night  for the shrinkee. Paige was a frequent attendee of those; exhausting  though they may be, they paid exceedingly well; but Holly was not  comfortable with being a shrunken, more or less helpless member of such a  chaotic, lawless party.     Becca, however, wasn't going to  have a choice. After the lull, around a day, maybe two, Paige was going  to take on one of those jobs, and the partygoers were going to get a  two-for-one deal. It would serve a dual purpose. It would reinforce her  perspective that what she was experiencing was normal, and it would  train her how to do her job as a shrunken toy. If she performed well, if  the training took like Paige wanted it to, then she would be done with  her.     If not, then she still had time for another few days to  break the woman. But Paige suspected that that would be unnecessary.  She had already done so much that had broken better people; Becca would  be a willing and eager employee by the end of the week.    \"Check it out, guys, they're here!\"     A cheer went up in the tiny room. At first glance, it would have seemed  like a throwaway sex scene from a low-budget HBO miniseries. Topless  women, wearing nothing but their revealing panties, were sprawled across  the room with men who were almost completely naked but for their  underwear. In a few cases, their flaccid dicks flopped out, practically  inviting the women to suck it. Paige had to admit that, in another time,  she would have taken the opportunity.    A closer glance  revealed an even more intimate reality, far beyond that of paid  television. There was a man and a woman sprawled across a crouch, their  limbs inseperably tangled, but his hand was clearly deep between her  legs, and the look on her face showed that he was doing a great job.  There was a woman who, bare-chested, had her face buried in a man's  crotch, her head bobbing up and down in one of the most aggressive  blowjobs Paige had ever seen. The man had his back against the wall,  hands gripping her head white-knuckle tight, and legs clearly struggling  to keep himself upright.    It was a party that Paige would  have willingly thrown herself into, but she was here on business, not  pleasure. About half of the faces in the room turned to her when she  entered, and the other half were too busy with their... business. Some  of that business involved bumping uglies, but a decent amount involved  pills and powders. \"Hey everyone!'' she said cheerily. Her voice was  lost almost immediately to the din of the music.    She reached  into her bag and produced a remote. It wasn't hers, it was Becca's.  \"Guess what?\" she asked, raising her voice to make it heard. A few more  heads turned her way. Comfortable with the attention she had, she pulled  Becca's naked, squirming body out of her bag as well. \"It's a two for  one deal!\"    Another cheer went up. She tossed Becca onto a  couch occupied by a woman who was about to pass out, wine in hand. The  drunk woman looked at the shrunken girl, and waved cheerily before her  head lolled back and her eyes fell shut. Becca's face was too small to  read her expression from that far away, but her body language was of  complete confusion, if not abject fear.    \"Oh, have a little  fun,\" Paige said at her, even though she knew that the shrunken woman  couldn't hear a word she said. She passed Becca's remote to the nearest  hand that grabbed for it, a black girl wearing nothing but Crocs and a  ball gag. She raised an eyebrow at the getup, and gave a look that  prompted a low chuckle from those who were still paying attention to  her.     Then she produced the second remote, her own, and cast  the bag to the floor. \"Who wants it?\" she yelled. A few hands went up,  and she tossed the remote like a frisbee at the the densest cluster of  hands.    She wasn't sure who caught it, because she shrank to  the size of an ant as soon as it landed. A second later, a giant came  stomping up towards her, his footsteps shaking the ground. His  surprisingly hairy body towered impossibly tall over her, but her eyes  drifted towards his impressive dick, which swung loosely between his  legs. When he came to a stop over her, hands on his hips, it continued  to swing back and forth for a second, the fluids that coated it glinting  in the dull light.    Oh Christ, she thought. He bent down to  pick her up, his thumb and middle finger closing around her like massive  walls, and the world spun as she ascended unbelievably quickly. This  was her kind of party. She could only hope that Becca would have as much  fun as she did.   Becca had no words to describe her feelings. The noise, the stench, the pure, unmitigated chaos. It was overwhelming. The writhing motions of a naked crowd packed so tightly together that she couldn't tell where any one person began or ended. It seemed impossible to her that anyone could actually enjoy this.      The shock as she was torn from Paige's bag and into the brightness of  the outside world. The panic as she was tossed carelessly through the  air. The fear as she looked up at the hungry-looking, drunken giantess  in the moment before she fell asleep. The confusion as she tried,  desperately, to figure out what the fuck was going on around her.     Suddenly, a massive hand scooped her up off the couch and closed around  her, blocking her view of the outside world. Becca could figure out  anything about who owned it besides the dark skin of the palm. Her world  spun and her stomach heaved as her captor walked around, their arms  swinging in their normal, rhythmic gait. In a few seconds, the light of  the room came crashing in on her, and Becca dropped to the ground.     No, not the ground. She looked around, trying to figure out what the  hell was going on, and felt a sudden pulse from her 'ground.' At that  moment, it clicked. The soft, purple texture beneath her, the  overwhelming stench, and, most tellingly, the man whose massive body  stretched out before her like a living mountain range. She had been  placed directly on top of his penis.    The man looked down at  her and grinned, as a sense of deep foreboding settled in her stomach.  Oh, God, what next? She looked up, and saw a dark-skinned ass almost  directly above her, and the hairy pussy positioned to come plunging down  on top of her.     It happened without warning, and it happened  in an instant. Her world went from the light, the pounding music, and  the fresh air of the outside world to the oppressive heat of the  giantess' vagina in a single moment. For a second, as she lay buried  deep in the massive woman at the head of the man's dick, she felt a  sense of excitement. This was what Holly had experienced. This is what  she had experienced, but she hadn't really appreciated the beauty and  intimacy of it at the time.     Beautiful though it was, it was  absolute chaos. There was a brief moment of peace where she held onto  the head of the man's dick, buried deep in the woman's pussy and  completely motionless. Then the pair began to fuck with a will. Becca  was carried up and down, up and down, up and down by the man's ferocious  thrusting, until the tight flesh of the giantess' vaginal walls caught  her leg and dragged her off of the head of his cock, leaving her trapped  between the hard bulk of his driving penis and the muscular walls of  her vagina.    The ferocity of their motion left her a leaf in a  storm. She rolled around chaotically, catching on every feature of the  couple's genitals. Heat filled her world, lubricant filled her lungs,  and competing heartbeats filled her ears. When two thrusts came every  second, a single minute felt like an eternity in this whirlwind of  squelching motion. After what felt like a year, the man finally stopped.     Becca was trapped directly underneath his penis. She had been in a  sorority long enough to recognize that thin, dark ridge of skin. Over  the deafening sound of wet, sliding flesh and rapid heartbeats that  pulsed from all sides, she couldn't hear any voices, but she could feel  the pulsing of the man's dick as he finally came. It flexed repeatedly,  and she could actually feel his cum driving out of his cock, as if she  was hugging a firehose.    Finally, it finished, and he pulled  out. The mushroom head of his dick grabbed her and dragged her along,  until she fell unceremoniously onto the couch. A transluscent mix of  lubricant and semen dripped down onto her face from the monolith of the  giant's penis, as the giantess' ass swung completely out of her view.      Becca coughed up a lungful of bodily fluids. Lubricant, sweat, semen,  whatever it was. The salty mix came surging forth, and it took a few  seconds before she could breathe fresh air again. It was pure chaos,  pure humiliation, but there was only one thing she could really take  away from it.    That was the hottest thing she had ever done.\n \n    Paige's first sight was of another woman, a round-faced,  slightly-plump Asian wearing a collar; she couldn't see where the chain  went; holding her mouth open wide, tongue sticking out. The man who held  her had a sense of the dramatic, because he let her observe the scene  for a moment before he let her loose.    Her stomach dropped as  she plunged downwards, and hit the woman's tongue hard. She was  immediately assaulted by the stench of the alcohol on the giantess'  breath, and the light from the outside world completely disappeared when  the woman closed her mouth.    The girl played with Paige for a  few moments, tossing her from cheek to cheek, pressing her up against  the roof of her mouth and tucking her under her tongue. Paige endured it  without fighting, as her body buffeted constantly against one hot, wet  wall of flesh after another. She had been here before, and she knew that  there was nothing she could do to make it any better for the giantess.     Finally, she found herself on the woman's tongue, and she opened her  mouth wide, letting the fresh air and bright light come flooding in.     Paige's first sight was the tip of the rock-hard, pulsing dick of the  man who had picked her up in the first place. She had to admit, with its  purple tip and narrow, wrinkled opening, it was kind of amusing. But  that amusement disappeared as it came plunging into the giantess'  wide-open mouth, and then came slamming down on top of her.    Great. She was a blowjob toy.         The adept muscle of the giantess' tongue held her fast in place as the  giant shoved his cock down her throat over and over and over again. The  noise was deafening and the heat was suffocating, but, amidst all of it,  Paige held fast, the hard, rippling flesh of the man's penis driving  hard over her face time and time again.     It carried on far  longer than Paige would have thought. The hard, textured flesh of the  giant's cock riding rough over her face without remorse, as the  giantess' soft, saliva, soaked tongue pressed her mercilessly into it.  Thrust after thrust, second after second, minute after minute, passed in  painful chaos, before the man finally came.    Paige was  pressed by the giantess' tongue hard against the underside of the man's  penis, so she had the misfortune of feeling every drop of cum pulse its  way out of his body. Finally, when he finished, she felt his heartbeat  slow, and the rock-hard flesh that pressed brutally against her face  started to soften.    That was when he pulled out, and the  giantess opened her mouth, tilting her head back. At her microscopic  size, Paige tumbled backwards into a mixed pool of saliva and cum,  plunging down into a world of hot, cloudy white fluid.    The  hot, sticky mess seemed to stretch on forever, and defied her efforts to  swim through it. She couldn't see what was happening, she couldn't even  tell which way was up and which way was down. Hopefully, the giantess  wouldn't be stupid enough to swallow.    A deafening, fleshy  sound, and Paige's stomach dropped as she plummeted down the giantess'  throat. The wrinkled flesh of her esophagos was clouded by the thick  fluid that surrounded her, until she fell with a splash into the thin  pool in the massive woman's stomach.     Paige wasn't even big  enough to stand here. She had to swim, treading water in the thick mix  of bodily fluids. That stupid bitch had ruined a night of good fun. If she was lucky, someone would call her out on it and force her to throw up, but that kind of thinking was nearly nonexistent in this world of booze, heat, and hormones. In all likelihood, they would forget that Paige had even been there, and she was small enough that she would slip effortlessly into the giantess' intestines, and be forced to endure the long way out.     She groaned in frustration. This was supposed to be a fun night, not one spent swimming in a cloudy mix of cum and spit at the bottom of some stranger's stomach. Maybe Becca was having a better time?\n","Becca's arms pounded helplessly against the lips that were wrapped around her waist, holding her in place no matter how hard she struggled. She kicked and squirmed uselessly against the massive tongue that explored the gap between her legs. All she could feel was the wet heat on her crotch, rubbing her most sensitive organ with brutal persistence. She fought for a moment, moaning her wordless protests, riding high on impossible pleasure, before she finally came.Her whole body tightened. She pushed mightily against the lips that held her body fast, her legs squeezed forcefully around the tongue that tortured her, and her core tightened so hard that she could barely breathe. Her vision blurred, the monolith of the giant's face above her turning into a flesh-colored abstraction. In that moment, time was both infinite and instant.Finally, she settled down, and let out a desperate, raspy gasp. She leaned forwards, seeking some grip to steady herself, and found nothing. And there was no reprieve, with the man's massive tongue continuing to slime itself up and down, left and right against the raw flesh between her legs.It was the fifth time she had orgasmed in this dude's mouth.In the fog of desperate, blinding pleasure, she was vaguely aware of the fact that the giant was sitting on the floor, leaning his head back onto the cushion of a stain-soaked couch. She didn't notice the giantess positioning herself above them until her massive hand came between her legs and split her labia, showing the bright pink flesh of her vagina beneath.Becca had a brief moment of lucidity; she was able to suppress the insistence of ecstasy, if only for a moment, with the shocking change in her surroundings. Above her, she could see the naked thighs of the darkest-skinned woman she had ever seen in her entire life. Those massive, smooth pillars of ebony skin led to an even darker gash right between them, which she had parted effortlessly to reveal a sliver of bright pink.In that moment, it was all Becca could see. Legs, ass, and pussy. Whatever was above; the body, the face, the personality behind it; it was a mystery. In that moment, it was the most beautiful woman she had ever seen.And then the giantess came crashing down. The thin slice of pink flesh suddenly became her entire world, and her whole upper body was buried in the giantess' vagina. The flesh around her was hot, tight, wet, and delicious.That moment of lucidity slipped away, and Becca, driven by the relentless force of the tongue between her legs, came again. She screamed helplessly into the flesh that surrounded her, and her entire body spasmed in desperate ecstasy. Was that what the giantess wanted? Could she even feel it? Becca hoped that it did something, but there was no way for her to know that it did. Soft, textured flesh slid up and down her body, but Becca hardly even noticed in her world of unadulterated pleasure. A rapid heartbeat pounded at her from all sides, muscles squeezed her entire body, but it seemed insignificant in her world of limitless climax.Suddenly, a powerful, almost painful force shoved her upwards from between her legs. Her body, which had more or less lived halfway in some stranger giantess, was pushed instantly all the way to her ankles. The insistent, squirming pleasure against her pussy disappeared as well. She yelped in surprise, but her voice was lost to the tons and tons of hot flesh that surrounded her, and her lungs immediately filled with salty bodily fluids.The walls around her tightened suddenly and violently at her unexpected entry. Flesh turned to stone, and Becca spent a precious few seconds completely unable to even draw breath. Finally, the walls relaxed, and she was able to take stock of her new surroundings.'Take stock,' what a joke. She was buried head to toe in the vagina of a woman ten times her size, completely helpless to whatever happened to her. Be it the stranger manipulating her body with the remote, or the giantess and her lover-of-the-moment using her body as-is for their own perverted ends. The giantess' pelvic muscles clenched hard again, squeezing brutally hard around Becca's body from head to toe, and forcing the air... well, fluid... from her lungs and twisting her limbs around each other. The massive woman's heartbeat pounded at her deafeningly from all sides, until the punishing contraction finally let up, and Becca let out a desperate, frothy breath of relief.Relief was short-lived. There was a vague sense of motion, of the giantess doing something with her hips, but it was impossible to tell from here. The walls oozed fluid and pulsed with a rapid, desperate heartbeat. Breathy, desperate moans seemed to fill her entire world. And, in a few short seconds, the brutal punishment of the giantess' pelvic muscles came crashing back down on top of her.Fuck! She couldn't let this giantess go it alone, whatever she was doing, right? If she just lay there and took it, she would be no better than some lonely pervert watching the thing in a porn video. Her world was one of pure sensory overload; hot, flesh, wet, pressure, stench, sound, chaos; but she could still do something.She fought. She kicked, punched, whipped her head around and writhed her body aginst the tight, slimy walls of flesh that surrounded her. Her efforts were rewarded almost immediately, another violent, bone-crushing contraction that should have absolutely killed her had she been full-sized in the same context.It lasted one second... two seconds... three... Then it finally let up, and she heard the giantess' desperate, pleasured gasps. She didn't let up, though, fighting like her life depended on it. A faint light, a breath of fresh air, a sudden pinch around her ankles, and she was torn in an instant back into the outside world. A harsh, chaotic blur of motion followed, her stomach turning with half a dozen twists in gravity, unable to keep track of which way was up and where the hell she was. Finaly, she was suspended upside down in front of the giantess' face, black-skinned, brown-eyed, her face the picture of post-coital bliss.\"But she looks so tasty,\" the massive woman moaned staring Becca's figure up and down. Her voice was deafening. \"Give her here,\" another voice ordered. Definitely male.Another hand, coarse in texture, meatier in form, came out of nowhere and wrapped around her body. Definitely male. Her stomach dropped at the sudden, violent motion, but it only lasted for a second. The giant's hand opened and she fell down to the soft surface of the couch.She was already growing as she fell. She looked and saw her remote in the giant's hands, his finger on the size slider. The giant seemed like your stereotypical frat guy, with rough stubble on his chin and an erect dick that hopped around hilariously with every single motion. He had pulled her size slider all the way to the top, and it became clear, as she grew, that he was working with some slightly under-sized equipment.But, at two feet tall, even four inches was a force to be reckoned with, and he clearly sought to prove that. He grabbed her legs and flipped her onto her face, spreading them wide and tilting her hips upwards. She tightened up against being so roughly and carelessly handled, but, the moment she felt the tip of his cock press up between her legs, she submitted wholly to him, tilting her hips just a little further.What she didn't expect was the sudden, insistent pressure of his dick against her asshole. She let out a shout; no lube, no warning... please don't. But he had a hand wrapped around each of her thighs, and, in that position, her will meant nothing. He pulled hard and thrusted harder, and his cock was all the way inside her in a single moment. Becca screamed. That sudden, shocking penetration was far beyond anything she had expected. It felt good, but it was deeply uncomfortable, but it was also... something else. She looked down, gasping at the purely overwhelming sensation, and was stunned to see the clear and explicit details of the giant's dick through the tight skin of her distended belly. Fuck, he was all the way inside her, up to her ribcage. The man let go of her thighs and straightened up. She screamed again as his penis, run through her body like a rotissere spit, raised her entire body weight into the air. Her legs squirmed and her arms clutched at her bulging belly; her core was tight, her breath came fast, and her pelvic muscles were spasming uncontrollably. She had never felt anything like this before...The giant's cock flexed once, and Becca let out a gutteral moan of deep pleasure, only vaguely aware of the stream of fluid that squirted, unbidden, from between her legs. Paige had left her with a watermelon-sized vibrator inside her body for nine full days, but this... this was something else. How had nobody told her about this?\"Holy shit,\" she heard the giantess whisper. Becca struggled to raise her head \"No, check this out,\" the man responded.In an instant, Becca was shrunk to her smallest size. In an instant, the dick that had filled her like nothing else suddenly became her entire body. In an instant, every single one of her senses was completely overwhelmed by the pressure of the bulk of that massive, rock-hard body inside her. Every muscle in her body squeezed hard in pleasure and desperation, but her struggles couldn't fight against the sheer, unyielding bulk of the man's dick any more than a bug could stand fast against the windshield of a bus. The weird, confusing cocktail of pain, pressure, and pleasure overwhelmed her mind and blurred her senses. The shocked, horny look on the black giantess' face, the giant's satisfied chuckle, even the disorienting way that she bounced and waggled on the man's dick with every step he took, it all seemed like something she was watching on a distant television. It didn't affect her, it couldn't. After all, she was too busy.Wow, that woman is really, very naked.The only thing that really penetrated Becca's brain fog was the moment that the giant plunged his dick, with her mounted helplessly on top of it, into the woman's vagina. The bright, loud world of the outside transitioned suddenly and violently to the suffocatingly hot, enveloping pressure inside the giantess' body. All she could see was pink flesh, smeared with cloudy white fluid that seemed to stick to everything. The instant of transition was so sudden, so overwhelming that, for a brief moment, she was aware of what was actually happening around her, and then she collapsed back into her world of mind-numbing eroticism.Motion. Friction. Noise. Motion. Heat. Fluid. Lots of motion. The world around her never stopped trying to demand her attention, but it was really hard to focus on any of it. Someone was having sex with someone else. She was vaguely involved. Who cared? She was savoring and struggling with penetration unlike anything she had ever dreamed. Finally, buried deep in the giantess, the man's cock pulsed with orgasm. Becca could feel his climax in her core, and it was the only thing that fully shattered the barrier between reality and the incredible, mind-numbing sexuality of the moment. It wasn't the sudden way he froze, it wasn't the twitching of his dick or the rapid heartbeats that pulsed around her entire body, it was something far worse.She was just too small. If she hadn't been impossibly turned into a living condom, she would have struggled to size up to a grain of rice. She had been stuck between giants making love at this size before, and the fluids that they produced in their frantic minutes of passion had been a churning ocean of hot slime to her. And, with the giant's cock buried incomprehensibly deep inside her body, its tip located somewhere so far inside her digestive tract that she could hardly tell where her body ended and it began, this moment was no exception.The giant's penis pulsed, squirting out the pathetic quarter-ounce of semen that was the fruit of his desperate, sweaty efforts. At her size, Becca felt a torrent of blisteringly-hot, sticky fluid shoot through her entire body, well up inside her throat, and spray forcefully out of her mouth, sour and unbearably salty.Oh God. Please, no.The giant's cock pulsed once, twice, three times more, and each time Becca felt the sickening stream of cum enter her asshole and shoot out of her mouth. She couldn't escape, she could barely move, she couldn't even cough despite the overwhelming urge. The ejaculate shot out of her mouth with what seemed like incredible volume, filling her narrow vision of the inside of the giantess' vagina with its cloudy white opacity. To the extent that she could even breathe with her body's transformation into a living condom, she couldn't fill her lungs with anything but the sticky excretions that erupted from her mouth.She had been able to savor the incredible feeling of penetration, of her body practically becoming the cock that was inside it, but that was gone now that she could feel the neauseating heat of the man's cum filling her entire body. If she wasn't mistaken, she could practically feel his sperm wriggling around against her insides. God, just get it over with.The man pulled out of the giantess' pussy, finally, and sized Becca up to two feet again before pulling his rapidly-softening cock out her body. The sudden relief of being brought to a normal size relative to the member that penetrated her was orgasmic, rivaled only by the effortless way he pulled out of her. When he sized her up, her body grew but, fortunately, the fluids that had filled her did not, and she felt normal in an instant. With the return of the relative anatomy that she was accustomed to, her sense of disgust vanished as well, and she found herself looking hungrily at the giantess' vagina towering in front of her, swollen, bright pink flesh oozing a thin dribble of cum.Her first instinct was to crawl forward and reach into it, or even shove her whole upper body in, and dare the giantess to refuse her efforts in those hyper-sensitive minutes after sex. The giant would probably be on board too, maybe he'd even pin the woman down to let Becca do her work undisturbed. But it wasn't her place to take charge like that. Her size put her permanently in a subordinate position, a willing participant in whatever the giants around her came up with. She sat down on her heels, waiting. Her ass was still sore, which was somewhat surprising given what she knew about her invulnerability, but it was a small price to pay for the incredible abuse that she had just endured.The giantess wasn't moving anymore. Cum dribbled from her naked crotch, but Becca didn't notice a single twitch. It seemed like she had passed out. She looked behind her, and found that the man that had turned her miniature body into a condom was slouched up against the couch as well, slipping quietly into a drunken stupor. The tip of his dick, soft and still glistening with fluid, just barely touched the leather of the couch. The party was still busy and loud as all hell, but these two were clearly spent. \"You done with that?\" a voice asked. Female. Becca wasn't sure where it came from. There was too much noise. But, if this party kept going on like it had been, the woman who spoke would make herself known with a shocking display of her genitals.The couch that Becca stood on rocked violently as the woman who spoke crashed into its back, wrapping her arms around the cushions. Becca recognized her VCR-sized remote in the giantess' hand a second before she recognized the massive woman's face.Holy shit. That was her sorority sister.Suzy looked down, her eyes locking onto Becca. \"Oh my God!\" she said, her eyes lighting up. \"Becca?\" Becca waved uncomfortably. She didn't hate being a shrunken sex toy, but she certaintly wasn't prepared for one of her closest friends to see her like this. Suzy's grin grew wider, and she vaulted over the back of the couch. Her massive body moved with frightening speed, and Becca had no chance to escape; Suzy's bare ass followed her thin, muscular legs in a single, smooth motion of hypnotizing grace, and crashed down directly on top of Becca's face.Becca's head hit the leather surface of the couch hard. She was dazed for a moment, but quickly came to, staring up at Suzy's impressive, massive body. Her head and shoulders were still free, but the rest of her body was trapped underneath the abiding heat of the massive woman's vulva, soft flesh wrapping eagerly around her tiny figure. From this perspective, Suzy seemed less like a person and more like a massive crotch with a tiny head attached; everything else was obscured by the soft, pale mound, waxed clean.\"You work for XMart, now?\" Suzy asked. Becca was well aware that, to anyone else, it would look like the stark-naked giantess was talking cheerily to her own crotch. \"We were wondering where you went!\"Becca's face burned with embarassment, her wild sexual abandon from not two minutes ago completely forgotten. One of her sorority sisters was not supposed to be here. Least of all Suzy! The shy, churchgoing girl, deeply uncomfortable even with suggestive jokes, seemed right at home in this noisy, smelly orgy of dozens of strangers. Fuck, was she wearing a collar?\"This party blows,\" Suzy told her. \"Wanna go back to the house?\"Becca didn't have a say in the matter, no matter how earnest Suzy seemed to be in phrasing it like a question. She saw the giantess fiddle with the remote, and then Becca started to shrink. It was slow and subtle, but, at her size and in her position, she noticed it immediately. Her body fell into itself, everything around her seemingly growing in size; Suzy watched it happen, beaming, until Becca's head slipped completely underneath her crotch, muting the noise of the outside and replacing the light with the dark, wrikled flesh of her vulva.Becca continued to shrink, the features of the hot, sensitive flesh around her getting larger and larger every second. She couldn't have been more than an inch tall when Suzy decided to wriggle her hips a little. At Becca's unfortunate size and in her unfortunate position, the motion caused the giantess' labia to scoop her up like a dog eating something off the floor. She was no longer in contact with the leather of couch, instead stuck in a world of hot, wet flesh, and still shrinking.There was a surge of motion; the giantess must have stood up, and Becca was still dwindling into nothingness. The fluid that coated the soft surfaces all around her had previously just been a thin, grime-like layer, but it was getting thicker and thicker, harder and harder to move in. Even if she had the strength and size to escape at this point, she would have been lost as a speck of dust on the ground. Back to the house? Did she mean the sorority house? Of course she did. The one place where she would be guaranteed to know most of the people who endeavored to use her tiny body as a sex toy. Fuck. Did Paige know what was going on? What happened if she had no idea where Becca had gone off to?Oh no. Was she going to be a permanent sex toy now? At her own sorority? For her own friends?\n","\"You okay?\"\"Urrrrghhhh...\"\"Yeah, you're fine...\"The giantess was an absolute mess. Her hair a wiry halo of knots and kinks, sweat beading on her forehead, and she was barely able to keep her eyes open. A thin strand of drool hung from her lips, but she was far too drunk to care. All her friend could do was keep her hair out of her face.Paige lay at the bottom of the sink, a slimy layer of boozy puke coating her entire body. She was deeply annoyed, and maybe a little buzzed from spending the last half hour swimming in alcohol in the pit of the woman's stomach. She tried to look as annoyed as she felt, but it wasn't getting across to either giantess, neither the one who was nearly blacked out, nor the one who was just sober enough to take care of her friend.At least the less-drunk one had the courtesy to notice Paige. \"I'm sorry,\" she mouthed. She wiped her drunken friend's mouth clean with a paper towel and pulled her away from the sink, leaving Paige to stew in the cooling puddle of sour, stinky fluids. With a groan, Paige struggled to her feet, trying, and failing, to flick sticky slime off her skin. What the hell was she supposed to do? She was in the basin of a sink that she had no chance of getting out of, and then what? She had no idea where her remote was, so she'd be an inch-tall bug wandering aimlessly around a room full of boozed-up, drugged-up, sexed-up strangers. She'd wind up swallowed whole, yet again.For her part, Paige tried, and failed, to work her way out of the sink. She had no idea what she would do next, but it didn't really matter, because she knew she wasn't going to get out anyway. She was too small, the walls too steep, and the slime on her skin too slippery for her to really make much purchase. All she could do was sit there and wait for someone to use the bathroom and notice her. Fortunately, even if she was too small to escape, she was too large to get accidentally flushed down the sink. So she just sat there, waiting, as minute after boring minute crawled by. Eventually, some woman burst into the bathroom, and Paige thought that she was saved, but the giantess paid her no mind. She just sat down on the toilet, did her business, and left without even washing her hands. Covered in vomit, and having just recently been subject to some of the most vile, perverted shit that anyone could imagine, Paige still couldn't help but think that was kind of gross. How long did it take to wash your hands? For a moment, the self-righteous sense of judgement overrode even her disappointment at having been denied her first chance to escape this porcelain prison.Her second chance came almost immediately afterwards, with another stranger who followed the woman into the bathroom barely a minute after she had left. Whoever the newcomer was, Paige could only see the top of their head, and it was hard for her to tell, from the hair alone, whether it was a man or a woman. It didn't particularly matter to her; all she could think about was how this new stranger was touching everything that the woman before them had, the woman who had left without washing her hands.It was gross to think about, but it was the curse of knowledge. Even for a woman in her profession, there was no way that she could have watched the way that two people used the same bathroom, back-to-back, and not have walked away disgusted. How the hell was she ever supposed to use a public bathroom ever again after this?Fortunately, the new arrival had at least some standard for hygiene, because they finished up with their noisy business at the toilet, and actually came to the sink to wash their hands. The stranger opened up the flow before even looking down, hitting Paige in the face with a torrent of chilly water. The waterfall cut out half a second later, and Paige wiped her face clean to look up at a woman who was, given the context, surprisingly sober, staring down at her with a toothy smile.\"Oh, hey, look at you,\" the giantess purred, leaning over the sink. She wore her dark hair close-cropped, shaven almost to the skin high up on the sides, and she wore a thin white tanktop above a red short skirt, the dark circles of her nipples clearly visible through her shirt; clearly someone was having a fun night. \"You're tiny...\"The woman leaned down even further, slumping up so close against the countertop that her breasts came to rest on the surface. Maybe it was her perspective, or maybe it was her size, but the stranger had bigger tits than Paige had ever seen in her life. \"How'd you get here? Is it okay if I wash my hands? I just used the bathroom.\"The massive woman didn't bother waiting for an answer, nor did she even consider rescuing Paige from the sink. She just flicked the water back on, deluging Paige with a deafening waterfall of frigid water. She couldn't see anything that was happening through the chaos of the waterflow, but the water quickly began to mix with slippery soap. Paige felt like she was drowning, caught beneath the white water of rapids, but there was only porcelain at her back, and a bathroom faucet directly over her face.Finally, it cut off, and Paige emerged a second later from the surface of the water, coughing desperately and soaked to the bone. But, for what it was worth, the torturous exercise had actually cleaned her of the slimy fluids that had coated her not a minute before. As the last dregs of the soapy water span down into the drain beneath her tiny body, she wiped her face off and looked up at the massive woman, who was busy drying her hands in a careless, mechanical way. She struggled to her feet, flicking water off her arms, and looked up at the woman looming over her. After a few, sloppy seconds, the massive woman tossed a wet wad of paper towels in the general direction of the trash can, and slumped up against the sink again. Paige's eyes boggled at how the giantess' tits jiggled and squished up against each other when they hit the hard surface of the sink's edge. She was straight, or so she thought, but the titanic sight of the sloppy, casual movement set her heart racing. At this size... Oh, God, what she wouldn't give to suck on those nipples.\"You're kinda cute,\" the giantess said, her head slumping against her shoulder. A finger came out of nowhere, and its massive bulk brushed against Paige's face, nearly knocking her back on her ass. The woman giggled, and she drew her finger back. \"Are you one of those toys they sent us? Where's your remote?\" Paige was nearly sure that her voice wouldn't be heard over the pounding of the music outside the bathroom, so she just shrugged, with an exaggerated moment. In response, the massive woman giggled, and shoved herself upright. Paige was captivated by the sight of the goddess' breasts lifting off from the sink and returning to form, firm and tight against her chest. Holy shit, she was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.\"So check it out, my husband is out there trying to bend some sophomore into coming home with us for a three-way. If I come out with you, it's a done deal, he's in.\" She flicked her head sideways and brushed her fingers against her temples, an instinctive gesture that said that her short hair was a relatively recent decision. \"What do you think? Want to ditch this place for some fun?\"Paige figured that, eventually, this sort of thing was inevitable at some point tonight, and Becca would likely get picked up and taken somewhere else as well. For her own safety, she was supposed to avoid going to a second location with a single person; when you were shrunk and alone in someone else's home, they had nothing restraining them from their own worst impulses; but sometimes it happened in places like this. The company always knew the location of the remote, which was functionally her own location, so, whatever happened tonight, both she and Becca could be recoverd. Which was why she nodded enthusiastically at the woman's offer. Already excited, the woman beamed, and scooped Paige out of the sink. \"Let's find your remote,\" she said, and walked quickly out of the bathroom.The noise, the heat, the stench of the party when they stepped out of the bathroom hit Paige like a brick wall. Swinging back and forth in the giantess' fist, it was nearly impossible for her to process what was happening around her as she wove through the party, until she finally dropped Paige off at a table and sat down at it. Paige looked around and saw two men, drinks in hand, gawking at her, whatever their conversation was beforehand was completely forgotten.Paige leaned up to the younger of the two men, pressing her body against his, and Paige did not fail to notice that she was careful to allow her breast to push against his arm. \"Guess who I found?\" she said, a longing in her voice that would make any man's knees weak. \"She said she'll come home with us if you do.\"The younger man was clearly overwhelmed, but was playing it reasonably well. \"Alright,\" he said, putting up his hands in surrender. \"You win.\" The giantess snuggled up to him, doing something Paige couldn't see with her hands under the table. \"You're going to love it, I promise.\"\"Is this hers, here?\" the other man asked, holding up the Paige's brick-sized remote. Paige nodded; she knew she wouldn't stand a chance of being heard at her size, even without the noise of the party, but they were paying attention to her response. The man played with the slider a bit, sizing Paige quickly up to what she guessed was around two or three inches, and the woman's busy hand came up from underneath and wrapped around Paige again, lifting her into the air. She knew the giantess was trying to be gentle, but every motion was still absolute chaos to her. \"How should we carry you?\" she asked, \"What's comfortable?\"Paige offered the best shrug that she could with her arms trapped in the woman's fingers. Normally, people made the decision for her, and they made a choice that you probably wouldn't make in church. And, between the three of them, there wasn't much that Paige wouldn't enjoy. The giantess took the cue from Paige's approximation of a shrug, and she turned a hungry look on the younger man. \"Then let's give Noah here a little preview. Stand up,\" she ordered.With those two words, her voice sharpened almost instantly. Even Paige suddenly felt the need to sit up straight and obey. Noah; at least Paige had one of their names now; stood up as if someone had put a tack in his chair, and the woman's tone softened a bit as she reached down with her free hand to unbutton the waistband of his pants. \"Just hold onto her down here, okay? And don't let her new roommate get too excited.\"Noah helped the giantess a bit as Paige was lowered down between his legs, pulling open the elastic waistband of his underwear. A warm, heady odor wafted up as she was brought down, cutting through the smell of booze and sex of the party all around, and, in the darkness, she could see that Noah had crudely shaved off his pubic hair, a clear line visible where he had not clipped any higher. He had come prepared, and Paige felt vaguely relieved that she wouldn't have to spend any time getting tangled up in wiry hair. The giantess was delicate about putting Paige in her new cotton-walled home, lowering her in feet-first and allowing her to fix her position so that she wouldn't slide down into the crotch of his briefs. She couldn't me more than three inches tall yet, and even Noah's flaccid dick was enormous compared to her. She was able to wrap her arms and legs around it like a sloth, hugging the circumcised head as best she could between her thighs. The giantess' slender fingers departed, and Paige had a brief sight of Noah staring down at her, amazement written on his face, before he let the waistband of his briefs snap shut.The tight-fitting underwear carried most of Paige's diminutive weight, pressing her gently against the soft, somewhat sticky flesh in front of her. She felt the jostling and heard the rustling of him buttoning up his pants, and the pressure increased somewhat when he did so, but the thick fabric left her almost completely in darkness, the giant's genitals filling the tiny space as little more than looming shadows. It wouldn't be too difficult for her to get him erect, but it didn't seem like any of her three customers particularly wanted that, so she had to stay still. For her part, the situation was incredibly, overwhelmingly erotic. The heat of him was pressed up against her entire body, and she could feel it practically radiating into the sensitive flesh between her legs. The fact that she had to try to stay still was practically torture; literally marinating in the smell and warmth of the giant sent her libido into overdrive, and her mind was flooded with images of what this massive cock could do to her, until she was so wet between the legs that she almost felt that she could fit it inside her.But it was hard for her to keep her position. Even with the pressure of the man's underwear keeping everything between his legs, including her, more or less in place, every movement he made sent everything around her swinging and bouncing. The soft flesh that surrounded her shifted unpredictably when he sat and when he stood, when he crossed and uncrossed his legs, and it was all she could do to hold on.And his dick itself seemed like a living thing. It grew in size slowly and unpredictably, the volume of his heartbeat growing until she could feel it pulsing against her skin, and the bulk of his penis pressing up more and more firmly against her, both making it harder to keep her grip and pushing her fast against the cotton at her back. It would then shrink with visible speed, and it seemed like he could even flex it. God, she couldn't wait. But all she could do was wait, and try to figure out how close they were to climbing into a bed based on the motion and the sounds.At some point, Noah started to let himself go. His dick started to grow hard, and harder, and harder, until he couldn't take the pressure anymore, and one of his hands plunged into his underwear and turned his cock upwards, with Paige still straddling it. Suddenly, she was upside-down, her body squeezed relentlessly up against the sandpaper texture of his freshly-shaved pubic region by the rock-hard dick against the front of her body. Then, suddenly, her world was flooded with light and fresh air. Noah's dick sprang away from his waist, and Paige found herself falling through the open air, landing hard on the ground. The ground? No. These were bedsheets. The light was the soft light of a household lamp. The room, as she looked around her, was a dimly-lit bedroom with a fancy, modern grey bedroom set, and an absolutely massive bed at its center. Paige realized a second too late that she was wasting time gawking at the scenery when there were people in the room with her, people who demanded her attention. Noah was completely naked, standing a little uncomfortably at the end of the bed, with a fully erect dick bobbing up and down directly above her. As she turned her gaze, she saw the other two, stripping their clothes with businesslike efficiency. Paige had hardly a moment to process it before they both slid, almost in unison, down into the bed. The man was still flaccid, and the woman drew up sinuously against him, crossing her thigh over his legs and rubbing it up and down with a dry sliding sound of skin against skin.They both looked right past Paige and up at Noah. \"Do you want it?\" the man asked. Without waiting for an answer, he rolled up onto his knees and walked over the giantess' body, finally sitting down directly on her face. She hardly even moved in protest. She actually even spread her legs, begging for whatever might come between them, and the man placed his hands gently on her inner thighs, framing the dark, wrinkly sliver of her labia between his fingers. \"Come on. Get it.\"Noah hesitated for a moment, just barely a moment, and the other man straightened up, grabbing Paige's remote off the bedstand, and tossed it at him. \"Why don't you start with her?\" he asked.In response, Noah sized Paige up all the way to two feet. As she grew, and as the world sprang into proper perspective around her, the bed she lay on was suddenly surprisingly busy, with the combined weight of two and one third of a person testing the frame, and yet another contemplating his own entrance to the party. Paige had a brief moment where her mind boggled at the possibilities of what could come next, but she didn't have to wait long.Noah tossed down the remote, and picked her up by the waist with both hands. The sudden motion overcame the strength of her core muscles, and she flopped backwards like a rag doll, her arms falling over her head, and his right hand came up to keep her steady. She felt the massive bulk of his hand against her back, calluses the size of her fists scratching the bare skin, and instinctively tried to twist around to see what he was doing. And, in doing so, she completely missed it when he positioned her body just right, and then drove her straight down onto his dick.If she had been full-sized, the giant's penis would have been nearly two feet long and thicker around than her arm. And, in half a second, it was buried completely inside her. The sudden, unexpected insertion sent violent shivers through her entire body, and she let out a short, high-pitched scream, completely unbidden. She looked down, mouth agape and eyes wide, her hand drifting unconsciously to her belly, where she could clearly see the mushroom shape of his dick imprinting through her abdominal muscles, even as they flexed uselessly against the massive bulk inside her.Even though she had experienced this, and far more, a dozen times before, her body created her response out of pure instinct. She knew that she only had a few seconds before he really started to show her what he was made of, and she wasted that time gently tracing the shape of his massive cock that pushed out through the skin of her belly with her fingers. She should have been split in half, his cock should have busted through all her organs and killed her on the spot, but she was fine. More than fine, even. The sensation of that massive bulk inside her was.... God...Her pelvic muscles squeezed involuntarily, and with the contraction came a powerful, body-shaking wave of pleasure. She knew that she wouldn't be able to handle this for much longer, but the night had just barely begun.\"You get her too,\" the woman commanded.Paige didn't have a whole lot of mobility with a dick buried halfway up her abdomen. She heard the bed creaking, a few heavy footsteps, and then the other man stepped right up to her. She stared up the long distance along the front of his hairy chest, marveling, through the fog of growing pleasure, at just how big he was.His hands gripped her head, gently but firmly, and tilted it backwards until she could see his dick bobbing up and down right at her head level. Her head was the size of an apple in his hands, and his fingers were as thick around as her wrist as they tangled in her hair. She felt, for a moment, like prey caught in the jaws of a hungry predator, and she was equally helpless to resist as his thumbs gently pinched her jaw and pried it open.She knew what he wanted, and she lay limp to let it happen. It would have only been awkward and difficult for him if she did anything to fight back, or even to help. The head of his cock, nearly as big as her actual head, pressed against her open mouth, stretching it further and further, wider and wider, impossibly large but never for a moment uncomfortable. His cock inched into her, sliding further into her mouth and down her throat, until she physically couldn't inhale anymore.Her head was fixed in place as fast as if she had been run through with a spit, so all she could see anymore was the veiny underside of his penis and his carefully-shaven balls. Her hand traced delicately across her throat; her neck was twice as thick, her throat already stretched to impossible proportions to accommodate the bulk of the massive cock, but it still sought to push deeper and deeper.That was the superpower of shrinking. Her body would never break, her skin would never tear, but with enough care and insistence, she would stretch. As far as she needed to accommodate whatever perverted desires her client wanted out of her tiny form.But apparently the older man was tired with the gentle approach. His hands left her head, gripped her around the abdomen, and, with a single thrust, shoved his entire cock down her throat.She would have screamed if she could even inhale. In one quick motion, her face was suddenly buried in the soft flesh of his ballsack, and she could feel, unbelievably, the one penis between her legs strike the one that was in her mouth when it drove all the way inside her. What the hell was going on with her body right now? Her vagina was stretched halfway up her abdomen, her throat was stretched halfway down, and the two cocks were apparently meeting in the middle. She was completely helpless, and almost completely unable to move, reduced to a toy between two giants.God, yes. What would happen if they shrank her down right now? \"Oh, fuck,\" she heard a voice say. Female, actually. Apparently, the woman liked what she was seeing. Pinned to the underside of one of the men's cocks, Paige couldn't see any of it, but she definitely liked what she was feeling.It was the older man who decided to start fucking her first. Placing his hands firmly around her torso, he pulled out a few inches, freeing Paige from the smothering flesh of his scrotum, then forced himself back down her throat. Testicles half the size of her head slapped against her face. She would have gagged, but the cock was filling her body so completely that her muscles couldn't even manage that simple action.The younger man moved his hands down, gripping her thighs in fists and spreading her legs wide, and pulled himself out slightly as well. Compared to the rough feeling of the dick down her throat, the sensation was absolutely divine, and it was definitely made hotter by the fact that she was so completely immobilized that she couldn't even vocalize her pleasure.When he pushed himself back into her, though, the ecstasy built so quickly that she climaxed the moment her hips met his. Her hands, the only part of her body she could move freely anymore, snapped down between her legs as if to push him away, but she was completely helpless.After a few more rough, uncoordinated thrusts, the two men fell into a slow, forceful rhythm, pulling out of her in unison, nearly until they were completely out of her tortured holes, and then thrusting together to fill her tiny body completely. Their cocks banged against each other every time they penetrated her, and she was so sensitive that every thrust brought her screaming up to another earth-shattering orgasm.Caught in a world of mind-numbing pleasure, she twitched, she writhed, she kicked and squirmed, but she was helpless in the grip of the two giants. The older man shifted his hands to pin her arms against her abdomen so she couldn't keep flailing them around, and then she was completely reduced to a sex toy. A living, seeing, feeling sex toy being penetrated at both ends and loving every minute of it.It was the older man who came first, and he came without warning, as deep inside her as he could go. She felt his cock flex in her throat, so violently that it felt like it would tear right out of the front of her body. She could feel the sperm shoot down the length of his cock, and the heat of it, the sheer volume of it filling her stomach felt like a sun had been ignited in her body. With her head buried in his scrotum, she thought she could even feel his testicles shifting around her.With his cock buried all the way inside her, his cum was shot directly into her stomach. She couldn't taste it, she couldn't savor the slimy sensation of swallowing it, she just felt it fill her belly with its heat.The giant's dick flexed once, twice, three times, each time injecting more semen into her stomach. And then, in one quick motion, he pulled all the way out, dragging a flood of his own cum with him. She coughed and sputtered as the salty taste filled her mouth, running down her face and clouding her vision. Her entire body weight was being held up by the cock that was inside her vagina, and she bounced up and down with it at the sudden motion.The older man's dick was still hard, glistening along its entire length with fluids, but her vision shifted as the younger man, still gripping her thighs, turned towards the bed. And she saw, through the hazy of ejaculate filling her eyes, the woman lying back, her hand between her spread legs, fascination on her face. \"Shrink her all the way,\" she ordered. Even with her legs spread, two fingers currently inserted into her own vagina, she still seemed to control the room. The older man scooped up the remote from the bed, and, in an instant, shrank Paige to her smallest size.The sensation was of penetration like nothing she could ever feel at full size. Her entire body shrank to nothing, and the cum that was still in her throat, her mouth, sprayed out in a quick, salty squirt as there was suddenly no more room inside her body for it. Her new remote got her down to one thirty-second of an inch, so there was practically nothing of her body left when the slider was at the bottom, just her vagina, still expanded to accommodate the younger man's rock hard dick, now hundreds of times larger than the rest of her body.Her perspective didn't change; she was still looking at the world upside-down from the tip of his dick, but to anyone else, she had been reduced to a latex-thin flesh condom, her dark flesh hugging every ridge and vein of his fully erect penis. All the other features of her body were too small for anyone to even notice; there was nothing left of her but her vagina, and nothing left of her world but mind-shattering ecstasy.Through the electrifying fog of pleasure, she heard the man chuckle. \"Now he's black where it counts.\"Okay, then.The woman spread her legs wide and fell onto her back, wordlessly begging to be fucked. Paige, the living condom, was helpless to do anything but watch, her view bouncing chaotically around, as the man clambered onto the bed and brought her slowly down between the giantess' legs.The giant gripped his cock... Paige?... at the base to guide it, and pressed her face mercilessly against the soft, fiery-hot flesh. Her perspective was completely buried inside the woman's vulva, so she had no idea what was going on or where she was, until she suddenly saw in front of her muscular walls, parting willingly for their new visitor, and felt the tight embrace of the giantess' vagina sliding down her cock-shaped body.The woman's vagina seemed bottomless, walls parting forever and ever, as the man slowly inserted himself. Paige felt the giant's hand leave the base of her body just as her face was pressed against the giantess' cervix, and he pushed even a little harder. Until, finally, both giant and giantess were fully joined at the hips, his dick completely buried inside her vagina, and Paige reduced to a nothing more than a thin layer of flesh between the two.If she could have fought, she would have. If she could have screamed, she would have. If she could have moved at all, she would have. But there was nothing left of her, she had become the giant's cock. All she could do was be, buried to the hilt inside another woman, wrapped along her entire length in heat and fluid and pressure, lost completely to a world of pleasure so absolute that orgasm was a constant state of being.When Noah started to fuck his lover, the motion barely did anything for her, but it was everything to her. She had completely lost all agency. She was no longer a human being. She was nothing more than her own vagina, filled to an unbelievable extent and completely breaking her mind's ability to process the pleasure. She was nothing more than Noah's cock, completely at his control and forced to endure wherever the hell he wanted to put her. She was nothing more than an endless orgasm, blinding her to reality and making time itself seem meaningless. This had to end eventually, but, right now, it felt like it was going on forever. It felt like it already had.Of the four of them, she was definitely having the most fun.\n","Becca spent a long and confusing time bouncing around with the unpredictable motions of her sorority sister's body. She was practically microscopic, absolutely helpless in a seemingly infinite world of wet, flesh, and heat, and she spent the whole time terrifying herself with imagined visions of what the giantess would do to her. What she could do to her. Sure, she had had her share of fun at the party, and, maybe, if she twisted herself around enough, she could find what was enjoyable in this life as a shrunken sex... thing. But Suzy had access to an entire sorority of women, hundreds of sex drives and fetishes that she could subject Becca to. She had no idea if she could handle it, and it was exactly what she had turned down when she had accepted her 'no limits' time with Holly. It was supposed to be penance for her mistakes. It may have had no limits, but she had held out hope that there were some implicit limits.But apparently not. Between Holly and Paige, she had been subjected to far more than she was prepared for, and now she might have to extend that experience to hundreds of women, many of whom she knew personally. The absolute last thing that she wanted was to know them all in the unforgivable way that a sex toy could.Maybe they would think the same. Maybe the time that they had spent living and laughing together as equals would make them think twice about exposing her to their darkest, most depraved selves. She didn't know everybody in the sorority that well, but she knew enough of them, right? You wouldn't do anything horrible to someone if you knew you had to face them later, right?In other words, you wouldn't do exactly what she had done to Holly, in the same circumstance?When Suzy finally released Becca into the outside world, she recognized the sights, smells, and sounds of her sorority building almost immediately. Lying in the crotch of the massive woman's underwear, a pathetic, fluid soaked mess, she hardly even noticed the half-naked goddess towering over her, her eyes instead fixed on a familiar pattern in the ceiling tiles, hoping and praying that their familiarity was just a coincidence.But it wasn't. Becca sized her up into a more manageable size - one inch, maybe two - plucked her out of her panties, and dropped her into the closest container at hand, which just happened to be a grimy water glass. Despite spending what felt like an eternity surrounded with burning hot flesh, the cold glass was almost unbearable against her fluid-soaked skin, and she hugged herself tight just to save her precious body heat.Suzy, of course, didn't give two shits about her comfort. She hiked her pants back up, grabbed the cup by the rim, and held it up to her face to study Becca's tiny body. The giantess' features were twisted into impossible, nightmarish shapes by the refraction through the curved glass, giving her a frighteningly visceral sense of what it was like to be studied under a microscope. Her entire reality was under the goddess' complete control. All she could do was to hope for mercy, or, failing that, an absence of cruelty.\"I'm gonna go to bed,\" Suzy told her, the deafening voice booming unnaturally through her tiny glas prison. \"So you just hang out here for now, okay? I'll come get you in the morning.\"Here? Where was here? Becca peered around her at the world, bent and twisted by the lens of the water glass, and slowly came to recognize the shapes and shadows of the sorority house common area. It was almost impossible to pass from one area in the house to another without coming through here, so anyone who lived in the house would certainly see her. And they would recognize her, which is what she feared the most. Welcome back! Now that you're tiny, do you mind if I...She shivered, but Suzy didn't give a shit. The giantess shifted her hand, and her world span wildly, unpredictably, and her back slammed hard into the fake wood surface of the table. It took a moment for her to process what had happened, even if it had been effortless for the giantess; she had turned the cup upside-down, trapping her on the table like a spider she was afraid to kill. Now the glass towered over her like a sour-smelling solitary confinement cell, and she was so small that there was nothing she could do to free herself. \"I'll just...\" Suzy muttered to herself, popping out a pen and a sticky pad. She wrote a few words down, and Becca could feel the vibration of the pen scratching against the paper through the table. She stripped the note off the top and slammed it down, with catastrophic force, on the top of the glass. Then she placed Becca's size remote on the table next to the glass, and made a kissy expression with her lips. \"Have fun!\" she said. With that, whatever it was, Suzy stood up and stepped away, receding rapidly into the shadows of the common room and leaving Becca alone with her remote, her prison, and whatever note the giantess had left behind.The light was dim, the words on the note were on the wrong side, but Becca could barely make out what they were by the scratches that came through the paper. The lettering was backwards, of course, but the little hearts she had drawn on all four corners were obvious immediately. It only took her a second to understand the words, but they filled her with dread.HAVE FUNPLS RETURNAh, fuck.Fortunately, Suzy had returned to the house at some ungodly late hour. So maybe Becca had a few hours to herself. Maybe she had some time to figure out how to get out from under the glass, maybe she could...Almost as soon as Suzy's footsteps receded into silence, she heard another set approaching. These were heavier, slower, less certain. But, through the refraction of the glass and the dim light of the common area, Becca couldn't make out whose they were until the woman was basically standing right over the table.Oh no. The goddess who towered over her, so pale that she seemed to glow in the dim light, was Tanya, one of her closest friends from initiation. Six foot four and rail thin despite her enthusiastic interest in volleyball, she loomed overhead like a skyscraper made of gangly limbs. Her baggy hoodie was a poncho on her thin frame, the sleeves stretching past her fingers and the bottom below her pajama shorts, but, from her tiny perspective, Becca had an unfortunate view of her naked breasts from underneath; already more than she had ever wanted to see of the other woman.Protect me, Tanya, she begged silently. The other girls here might see me as nothing but a sex toy, but you don't, do you? Just take me to your room and keep me safe until this whole bullshit month with X-Mart is finally over.Tanya rubbed her eyes with the palms of her hands, clearly on a midnight trip between her bedroom and the bathroom when the new fixture at the center of the common room had grabbed her attention. Through one half-open eye, she regarded the note on top of Becca's glass prison, and then her face brightened. She leaned down, hands on her knees, to get a closer look.\"Oh my God, Becca?\" she whispered. \"Is that you?\"Becca, sitting on the table, hugging her knees tight to her chest, nodded meekly. Tanya clearly saw it, because she straightened up and looked around. She raised one hand to her chin, chewing thoughtfully on the frayed sleeve of her hoodie, then bent back down, lifting the glass that had served as Becca's impromptu prison.Becca had the optimism, the foolish optimism, to be grateful for half a second, before the giantess' other hand grabbed her size remote. And then she found massive fingers, shrouded in the sleeve of a hoodie, wrapping around her tiny body. She barely had time to process what was happening before her stomach lurched with a sudden motion across infinite space.Tanya flicked her wrist to free her hand from the confines of her sleeve, an action that was careless to her but was so violent to Becca that she knew that it should have killed her. It was like being caught in a car crash at a hundred miles an hour, and surviving. It was disorienting like nothing she knew, but Tanya acted like it was nothing as she studied the tiny human trapped between her fingers.\"I didn't know!\" she whispered furtively. \"You should have told me you were gonna shrink yourself down!\"I didn't want to, Becca thought, still dazed. But Tanya wasn't very interested in her input anyway, it seemed. The giantess started to move, a rhythm of distant booms and strange vibrations that Becca was able to recognize as walking, even if the way the background shifted around the goddess who filled her vision was incomprehensible. \"I always wanted to...\" she began, speaking still in a quiet whisper, but faltered. \"But I didn't know if you would...\"Tanya was silent for another moment, but Becca was already starting to know where this was going, and she wasn't a fan. She heard a door open, and felt the subtle shift from the common area into a room in which someone had already been sleeping for hours. The heat, the quiet, the body odor; she knew where she was even without being able to see it, and when she heard the door click shut behind her, she knew exactly what she was in for.\"If I knew... I would have shrunk myself for you...\" Tanya said sheepishly, still not quite making eye contact with the tiny woman in her hand.Becca suddenly felt something underneath her, and the pressure around her tiny body let up. Tanya still loomed overhead, but there was... something in her expression now. Something other than the tired, awkward woman that had been there before. Becca looked around, and saw that she had been placed on a vast expanse of rumpled cloth, soft as clouds underneath her ephemeral weight, still a bit warm and a bit smelly from the body that had been lying on it not minutes before. Tanya's bed. Oh, she was in trouble.\"Just... imagine that you're me,\" Tanya told her. With a delicate wash of heat and scent, the giantess grabbed her hoodie by the hem and ripped it off over her head. The body that was hidden beneath was strikingly thin, ribs clearly visible beneath ghostly-pale skin. Becca could see her abdominal muscles flexing and shifting as she bent down to slide off her shorts as well. \"I'll pretend that I'm you, okay?\"No. Not okay. Becca was not okay with any of this. But the fishy odor that flooded the room when the pants came off told her that Tanya was not very interested in her dissent. Now stark naked, the giantess lifted the remote, and delicately pushed the size slider up. Two inches, three, four, five, six. Tanya stopped right when Becca thought she might be large enough to escape, or to at least communicate that she wanted nothing to do with any of this, and then she dropped the remote and her hand struck out like a cobra, grabbing her around the legs with merciless strength.Becca screamed, and was ripped off the bed and into the air. Before she knew what was happening, her head was enclosed inside the giantess' mouth, a tongue half her size buffeting against her and smearing every inch of her skin with spit. Her head slammed uncomfortably into Tanya's teeth and her hard palate as she was licked, bent, sucked, and twisted. Her vision blurred with fluid and her lungs burned for air, and it seemed to last forever until it was suddenly over.She dangled upside-down, coughing desperately, only dimly aware of the fact that Tanya had laid down on the bed during her oral torture. Her thin breasts sagged slightly to either side, knees up and legs spread, and, as she recovered, Becca's gaze was drawn magnetically to the clean-shaven junction between her legs. Hip bones stuck out from the smooth flesh like tent supports, and her pubic mound ­was so starkly pronounced that it seemed like the ghost of a third leg, yearning to break free. God, how could any woman be that skinny? You could probably drive a train through her thigh gap.As if in punishment for her stray thought, Tanya whipped Becca's tiny body down the length of her titanic figure and between her legs. In a second, she found her face pressed against soft, wet flesh, fluid smearing uncomfortably against her as she tried to twist away to get a breath of fresh air. Her arms flailed instinctively, trying to resist, but she was completely helpless. Tanya guided Becca's tiny body directly to the opening to her vagina without delay and without mercy. She felt her head slip into the tight, fleshy tunnel, and was just able to gasp, taking in more fluid than air when she did, before Tanya plunged her all the way in.Her flailing arms were pinned straight against her sides, her legs were stuck fast together, and her torso was forced ramrod straight. Burning hot flesh, pounding with a distant and rapid heartbeat, pulsed all around her, and, though she couldn't see anything but the wrinkled pink flesh that was wrapped around her face like latex, she could feel the hard surface of the massive woman's cervix pressing down on her head. Only her legs were free below the knee, but the grip that held them was unyielding.Through the impossibly overwhelming sensation of merely being inside the giantess, she heard Tanya let out a shuddering moan. Her pelvic muscles flexed involuntarily as she did, beating against Becca mercilessly from all sides, bending her uncomfortably like a flagpole whipping in the wind. Even at her relatively larger size, there was absolutely nothing she could do to fight even the casual strength of the massive woman's body. Her vagina wanted a dildo, and it would do whatever it had to to make sure that Becca's tiny body would play the role.And Tanya wasn't too worried about how well suited the tiny woman was for the job either.     After savoring the initial penetration for a moment, she pulled Becca's tiny body out almost all the way to her neck, slowly, carefully, until she started to hope that she might actually get a taste of fresh air, then plunged her all the way back in with brutal force. Becca let out a surprised shout at the sudden, violent motion, and was left coughing and squirming uncomfortably when she sucked down half a lungful of frothy, creamy slime.Tanya, of course, didn't care. If anything, the squirming was a bonus to her. She repeated the halting, awkward motion once or twice, but quickly found her rhythm, and Becca was quickly being ripped back and forth with inhuman speed. The squelching of wet flesh was deafening. There was nothing in her world but heat and motion, suffocating flesh and slimy fluid suffusing her mouth, her flesh, her entire existence.But it only lasted a minute. Or maybe an hour. The motion was so violent and chaotic that it was impossible for her to keep track. But it was abundantly clear when it was over. When Tanya reached orgasm, her pelvic muscles clenched down on Becca with a force that felt like being stepped on. The walls of her vagina turned to steel and clamped down until there wasn't even a breath of space between them, enveloping her tiny body completely in suffocating flesh.She was buried completely inside Tanya, consumed from her head to her knees, and the fist that gripped her ankles squeezed her just as brutally, freezing her completely in place as the giantess' hips bucked in the throes of ecstasy. Becca's every muscle strained, her lungs burned for breath, but she was a bug caught under the treads of a tank. The only thing that would move her would be the giantess herself.After an eternity, the woman's muscles relaxed, but they only gave Becca the chance for one ragged, fluid-filled inhale before they clamped down again, and again, and again. Five times, maybe six, each time a unique torture, pinned down by muscle and riding along helplessly with the giantess' twitching hips.And then it was finally over. In a single, unceremonious motion, Tanya ripped her out into the open, dangling her battered body upside-down over her own pale, fragile frame. The dim confines of her room seemed blindingly bright, the still air, heavy with the stink of sex, brutally cold. In the sudden, violent transition, she almost wished that she could go back in.Tanya, legs askew, face flushed and breathing heavy, was a radiant picture of post-coital bliss, eyeing her human toy with a look that said that she would go for one more if she could. Becca, on the other hand, was a mess. Dangling upside-down, too weak to really get control of herself, coated head to toe in clingy slime. She coughed desperately, unable to expel the heavy fluid completely from her lungs, and tried in vain to wipe away slime-slick strands of hair that matted her face. Swinging chaotically back and forth in the giantess' fist, she missed her own face with her hands more often than not.\"Oh, fuck,\" Tanya whispered lustily, then her face suddenly took on a look of guilt, and she said, \"Fuck, I'm sorry.\" Becca was suddenly in free-fall, and she landed softly on the mattress, bouncing around as Tanya swung her legs off the bed and grabbed her hoodie in one hand and the size remote in the other. \"I'm sorry,\" she repeated. She pushed a button on the remote, and all the funk that was coating Becca's skin, her face, her hair was suddenly gone. She could even breathe more easily now. The reprieve was short-lived, though, because Tanya quickly slipped her hoodie back on, and then scooped Becca up in her fist, sizing her down a bit for easy carry.\"I'm sorry,\" she said again, as she started walking. She didn't even bother putting her pants back on; she seemed to want Becca out of her room as quickly as possible. Were those tears on her face? \"Let's just say...\" She paused, unable to make eye contact with her tiny toy. \"I'm sorry.\"It was a quick trip across the sorority house from Tanya's room back to the common room, and Tanya quickly slipped Becca back under the glass she had found her in, placing the remote on top and scurrying away before Becca had the chance to communicate anything to her. From lust to pleasure to guilt, in very quick order. If Becca was ever full size again, it was going to be very, very awkward to ever speak to Tanya again. When, not if. When. She had to keep reminding herself that this was just temporary. One month, and then it was over. But how long had it been already? Two months? A year? As the days dragged on, each one seemingly longer than the last, an unending cavalcade of sexual abuse and indulgent fantasies, the life she had been living felt like it was an eternity ago, and that this was her new one forever.It was easy to be hopeless. Especially now, with the weight of the remote holding the glass down, making any chance of escape impossible. She just sat there, hugging her knees to her chest, feeling battered and dirty despite her invincible, magically-cleaned body. Just as she was starting to feel sorry for herself, she felt approaching footsteps through the table. Quick and with purpose, so not Tanya, but she didn't recognize who it was from the gait alone, until the woman was towering over the table, staring down curiously at Becca's prison.The remote was in the way, so she couldn't see the giant woman's face, but she recognized the figure, lean and olive-skinned, wearing a sports bra and a pair of running shorts with compression shorts underneath. Winnie, a cross-country runner two years Becca's senior, who was only one semester away from graduating with a degree in pure mathematics.Becca recognized her immediately as the woman who had been at times the most friendly and at times the most merciless in her initiation. Absolutely relentless in both school and sports, she was probably the only person in the house who would be up early to work out at the same time that the partygoers were just getting to bed.But she was going to work out, right? She would just look at Becca, maybe tease her a bit about being trapped under a simple glass, but she'd leave her alone, right?She leaned down, peering at Becca through the glass with a curious expression, dark hair pulled back into a simple ponytail. \"Well,\" she said, the word dripping with expression and intent that made Becca's heart stop, \"Look at you.\"She grabbed the remote, causing the glass to scrape against the table a bit, and quickly shrank Becca down even more, until she was barely an inch tall. \"I guess this is your punishment for hogging the last one?\" she asked. \"You don't have any limits, do you?\"Yes, I do, Becca thought. Whatever you are about to do, you're not allowed to do that. But Winnie's question was rhetorical; she carried right on as she lifted up the glass and set it on top of the remote, giving Becca the freedom to run, but not to escape. \"The last one explicitly said that I wasn't supposed to do this, so I'm glad that you're here.\" She plucked Becca off the table between thumb and forefinger, leaving her face free to watch what the giantess was planning to do with her. Winnie put the toe of her left foot against the heel of her right, and lifted her right foot out of her fancy new running shoes, then pulled her ankle sock down to her toes. \"Just a few miles, okay?\" she asked.Ah, fuck. Becca squirmed to try to show her protest, but Winnie didn't seem to notice, or to care. Honestly, she probably would have been happier knowing that Becca didn't want this. She shoved Becca up into the arch of her foot with her forefinger, and quickly pulled the sock back up over her ankle with the rest of her hand, leaving Becca trapped against smooth, tough skin.She felt the motion of the giantess lowering her foot, heard the chaotic rubbing of cloth as she pushed it into her shoe, and then, without warning or ceremony, her weight came crashing down.The pressure was incredible. There were no words for it. Becca had expended her capacity for misery under the compressive strength of Tanya's pelvic muscles, but this, with all hundred and twenty pounds of the skinny athlete's weight pressed down directly on her face, was unlike anything she could have imagined.The weight let up for a moment when Winnie took a step forwards, and Becca was able to take a breath, oppressively hot and heavy with the stench of sweat, before Winnie's foot returned to the ground with a deafening thud, bringing all the pressure and even more down on top of her. She should have burst open like a grape under a steamroller, but she couldn't, so she just had to suffer. Two steps, and she was already hating life. She rather would have spent a lifetime in any woman's vagina than another second under Winnie's foot. But the giantess didn't know one bit about the misery she was experiencing, she was just living her life, out for an early morning run.Just a few miles...\n","When Holly had first started working at XMart, her relationship with Paige, her assigned partner and trainer, had started out strictly professional. But 'professional' meant something very different when your working hours were filled with each others' deepest, darkest, stinkiest intimacies. What most people thought professionalism was was a polite, wordless disinterest in everything about a person but the words and ideas that they put right in front of you, but it was something very different when your paycheck came from learning your way around the inside of a stranger's underwear.But Paige showed her how to do that job right. Not just right, even, she taught her how to love it, and, for that incredible experience, Holly loved her. It was why, now, they lived together. It's why they shared a bed. It's why they oriented their working schedules - and the days or even weeks they would spend out of the real world as shrunken slaves to well-monied clients - around each other. It's why they shared a title on a house. It's why so many people they knew used the phrase \"Holly and Paige\" whenever they talked about either of them.It's why, every once in a while, Holly used her perks as an employee of XMart to shrink herself down and enjoy some time as Paige's shrunken toy.Holly was always more comfortable being shrunken with Paige than the other way around, and Paige was more than happy to play whatever role Holly wanted of the giantess. Be it a cruel jailer, an insatiable succubus, or even a gentle giantess totally submissive to her tiny dominatrix. She played out any size fantasy with delight and skill, though Holly had to admit that Paige was not that great at pretending to be unaware of her presence. She found her way from the underneath her roommate's foot and into her panties far too often to be believable.But this time, after Paige had slumped home from a party job that she had gone to with Becca, exhaustion written into her every move, Holly offered that Paige could take full control this time. For the next few days, she was whatever Paige needed her to be, at whatever size. She was being nice, but she also earnestly meant it; Paige had spent so long entertaining her that she felt that she needed to return the favor.To Holly's surprise, Paige didn't actually want to do anything, at least not at first. Instead, she left Holly at her full two foot height, then stripped naked and brought her along into their bed. The giantess rolled onto her side, facing Holly, slipped both her hands under her pillow, and closed her eyes.They lay there together, silent and still, for a very long time. Holly was genuinely surprised; Paige hadn't told her what her plans were, but her roommate had long shown a boundless appetite for all sorts of adventures when size was involved before, regardless of who was shrunk at the time. And now she just wanted to relax? It was surprising, but welcome. For a few minutes, the only sound was the soft rasp of the giantess breathing through her nose. Slow, steady, and deep, as if she was asleep already. It was a soothing rhythm, one that Holly could almost fall asleep to herself.Then the air handler kicked on with a click and a whir, and, shortly after, Holy felt a wash of freshly cooled air fall onto the bed. The chill sent goosebumps racing up and down her naked skin, and she crawled a little closer to Paige, letting the heat that radiated off her naked body protect her from the cold outside air.Listening to the distant whir of the fan competing with the closer hiss of Paige's breath, Holly stared the goddess up and down.It was a body she had both worshiped and used countless times before, but she still couldn't help but admire it. Her skin was hypnotically smooth, and so dark that Holly felt like she might just fall in. The way her arms were folded up underneath the pillow made her breasts squeeze together alluringly, and Holly found herself staring at them for a long time, imagining the soft, enveloping warmth of being between them if she was just a little bit smaller.Every inch of the giantess was a playground that Holly could spend lifetimes fantasizing about; the vast array of sizes that she could be reduced to could turn any part of Paige's body into her entire world, and worshiping it her sole purpose. Those feet, so far away right now, could be her jailers, trapping Holly between Paige's shoe and the whole weight of her massive body, or they could be her entire universe, reduced to a speck of dust clinging between her toes.Her stomach, smooth with the lines of her abdominal muscles just barely visible, concealed a living prison that would treat Holly's entire body as nothing more than another piece of food, and Paige, with the size remote in hand, had total control over whether she would sit heavy in her stomach forever, or if she carried on a days' long journey through her entire digestive tract.And, between her legs... There, just barely darkened with the first signs of stubble, was the promise of indescribable delight for both of them, no matter what size Paige chose for her.She let her gaze drift slowly back up Paige's body, drinking it all in, until she looked up and realized the giantess' eyes were open. Massive, brown irises that looked like they might just suck her tiny body in, with pitch-black pupils that widened the moment their eyes met. Holly jumped slightly in response, prompting the other woman's mouth to split into a wide, brilliantly white grin. \"What are you looking at?\" she asked.Holly didn't quite process the question, however, fantasizing instead about being the right size to be reduced to a plaything for those lips, those teeth, that tongue... And what lay beyond... \"What?\" she asked back.Paige's grin widened, and she let out an amused-sounding sigh through her nose. Skin slid noisily across bedsheets, and suddenly both of Paige's hands were on Holly's back, one arm underneath her and one over her, drawing her to the goddess' chest like a fly caught by a frog's tongue.She found herself pressed up against the giant woman's chest, arms cradling her like a teddy bear. Despite being trapped, almost completely unable to move, Holly couldn't help but feel safe in Paige's embrace. She shifted her shoulders slightly and nuzzled up against the giantess' breast, a small, satisfied sound escaping her lips. When Paige spoke, Holly could feel it almost as much as she could hear it. \"Do you want to play a little?\" she asked.\"Mmhmm,\" Holly answered, not quite able to speak coherently with her face pressed against Paige's breast.One of the giantess' hands, each finger thicker around than her wrist, slid down her back and wrapped gently around her left leg. Holly felt her heartbeat quicken, and her breath catch as it slid up her thigh, a single finger brushing delicately against he crotch. The thrill of possibility.\"What do you want to do?\" Paige asked.She was already a plaything in her lover's hands, and her heart began to race at the thought, at the feeling of a hand so big and strong tracing the inside of her thigh so delicately. She already couldn't wait to be used. She twisted her neck up to look at Paige, and to speak a little more clearly, \"Whatever you want,\" she answered.Paige's toothy grin shifted somewhat, talking on an almost predatory look that was simultaneously terrifying and thrilling. For a moment, Holly could see the giantess' imagination running, trying to figure out not what to do with her shrunken lover, but what to do with her first. It only lasted a moment, but it was a moment that seemed to drag on for eternity.\"Good,\" she finally decided.Then heaven, earth, and the goddess all moved as one. Or, rather, Paige just rolled onto her other side to search her nightstand. As she shuffled around for whatever was in there, Holy found her gaze drifting down to the massive woman's ass. Tight muscle and smooth skin made for a temple that was fit to be worshiped in at any size, and she normally didn't even like butt stuff.Paige rolled onto her back, then sat up. In her left hand, she held Holly's new size remote, and, in her right, she held a pink vibrator. She sat the size remote down beside Holly, then made a big show of slowly sizing her down, rotating the size wheel with a single finger. By the time she hit a single foot, half her maximum size, Paige sat the vibrator down next to her as well. A Bad Dragon number, with all sorts of bumps, lines, and ridges to simulate the cock of some impossible fantasy creature, it was now nearly as big as she was, and getting bigger.When Holly finally stopped shrinking, the number on her remote's screen was a clear five inches, but, next to the vibrator, she felt quite a bit smaller. And, compared to some of the other toys Paige used, it wasn't even that large.\"Get on,\" Paige ordered, her voice booming from above.Holly obeyed her goddess without hesitation, climbing onto the vibrator around its middle point and straddling it like a horse. At her size, it had just about the bulk of a horse between her legs, and the otherworldly physiology of the alien genitalia that it simulated provided plenty of handholds.Paige's right hands, each finger now nearly as tall as she was, wrapped around the base and hoisted the toy effortlessly into the air, with Holly holding on for dear life, until it was right up at her face. She eyed it hungrily for a moment, then her mouth opened wide, and she plunged the tip of the dildo in.The giantess took the dildo into her mouth right up to where Holly was riding it, slathering it with saliva to lubricate it. She pulled it out, then slid it back in, moving with unbearable sensuality. If she was trying to turn Holly on, it was working; she was just about to crawl forward and join the tip of the dildo in that saliva bath before, with a pop, Paige pulled it all the way out of her mouth.The foreplay done, Paige stretched out on the bed like a kitten, drawing her legs all the way out and uttering a tiny moan. Then she lifted up her knees and spread them wide. The vibrator, and Holly along with it, was tossed around like an afterthought as she shifted positions, but she managed to hold on and she found herself staring right at the giantess' crotch. Through the soft, nearly black wrinkled flesh of her labia, at the tiny sliver of stunningly bright pink was visible. A small, delicate thing, a playground, a prison, an infinite promise for someone with infinite size to experience it with. A single finger, a single switch, and the vibrator burst to life between Holly's legs. The electrifying sensation shot up from her crotch and seized her entire body, drawing a shocked yelp from her lips, that quickly twisted into a pleasured moan. Her entire body tightened up in a wave of knife-sharp ecstasy, and then completely fell limp. At the same time, Paige slowly inserted the vibrator into herself. The dark lips of her labia spread wide, the pink flesh beneath stretched open, and inch after inch of the vibrating bulk was lost inside Paige's body.Holly managed to struggle back upright as the suffocating heat and stench of Paige's vagina inched closer. But then another spike of pleasure sent her entire body convulsing, her legs squeezed so tight that she thought she would slice the vibrator in half. And then it passed, and she slumped up aginst the wall of flesh that was now right in front of her.Holly was only dimly aware of Paige's own building sounds of pleasure. She only barely appreciated that she had refrained from pushing the toy any deeper, so Holly could ride it to orgasm instead of being crushed by the giantess' vagina. The only thing she had the focus to deal with was keeping her balance on the massive vibrating bulk as it wreaked her body with pleasure and quickly lifted her to orgasm.Trapped in ecstasy, her body writhed helplessly against Paige's vulva, almost as large as she was. She covered herself front and back in slimy lubricant as she did so, and instinctively sought refuge from the all-pervasive pleasure in the steaming hot, bright pink bed of flesh in front of her. Her legs were so tight that hser feet were going numb, her hands gripped the vibrator white-knuckle tight, and then...And then she came. The climax blinded her completely, stole control from her, even muffled her hearing. before she knew what was happening, she had fallen off the dildo and onto the bed, tumbling down into the imprint made by the weight of Paige's ass.Gasping for breath, arms and legs a tangled mess, she could only watch as Paige continued to work herself up. The giantess seemed to notice that her vibrator had lost its passenger, because she started to slowly thrust it in and out of herself. The pliant flesh slid and stretched around the oddly-shaped toy, and lubricant, creamy white with discharge, began to slowly drip out of the depths of the woman's body, dribbling down the dark flesh towards Holly.It was an amazing sight. The goddess' moans joining in chorus with the buzzing that modulated from clear and bright to being muffled by her flesh as Paige drove it in and out of herself. Even in the warm, satisfied post-orgasm glow, a hungry part of Holly desperately wished that she could be that vibrator in that moment.When Paige climaxed, the dildo was all the way inside her, its vibration muted by tons and tons of flesh, so Holly could hear the pleasured gasps as clear as day. Blinded by ecstasy, the giantess' legs squeezed hard together, and her thighs steamrolled over Holly, smothering her in smooth, dark, red-hot skin  and pinning her to the mattress beneath their tremendous weight.Holly savored every second of it, reveling in the way her entire body was enveloped by the back of Paige's thigh, sucking down as much of the smell, the taste of it, as she could. It hardly lasted long enough, though. Paige came down from the height of her orgasm, and, all at once, backed off of Holly and pulled the vibrator out of her vagina with a wet, schlick sound.Paige, still breathing hard,m sat down cross-legged far enough from Holly that she didn't loom overhead anymore, dildo still in her hand, her skin glistening with sweat and her hair was a mess already. She took a deep breath, let it out as a satisfied sigh, and smiled. \"Wow.\"Holly was still sprawled out on her back. \"Wow,\" she agreed.Paige leaned forward and grabbed Holly's remote, dragging it towards herself and setting it on her leg. She looked pointedly down at the controls, then at Holly. \"Want to go more?\"Holly breathed her own sigh, but didn't bother nodding. Whatever Paige wanted of her right now, she would do to her, regardless of whether Holly agreed. But whatever it was, Holly desperately wanted it. \"Hell yes.\"Paige sized holy back up to her full two feet. Still apparently recovering from her own orgasm,  the shrunken woman didn't move much when she did so, so Paige took it upon herself to put her into the position. She flipped Holly onto her belly, lifted her ass into the air, and spread her knees slightly. Holly trusted Paige implicitly; her body was pliant like clay in her hands, and she held the position she left her in obediently. Did she know what Paige had planned, or could she just guess? Either way, she would love it.\"Relax,\" she ordered the tiny. Holly didn't respond, but, when Paige put the tip of her vibrator, now turned, off, against her crotch, she saw the shrunken woman's expression. Eyes widened in shock, then closed in anticipation, lips drawing into a hungry, horny grin. She even wiggled her hips a little bit!Then Paige started to push, and the tiny woman's pussy spread wide to swallow the massive, massive bulk of the vibrator. Paige was as gentle about it as she could be, both as a favor to Holly and so she could personally watch the shrunken woman's pleasured shock as more and more of the monster fit inside her. It would all fit, of course, all nine inches, and that's exactly what Paige was going for, save for an inch or so at the bottom so she could reach the controls.Deeper, deeper, deeper. Holly definitely reached orgasm at least once, and Paige paused for a few seconds so she could recover before pushing it even deeper. After a few slow minutes, Holly's body was distended all the way to her neck, her entire body stretched impossibly wide to accommodate a dildo that was almost half her height.Paige could have just turned it on at that point and left Holly to stew in a cloud of unimaginable pleasure, as she had done so many times to trainees, to Holly, and even to herself. But Holly had one of the new size remotes. With the knob instead of the slider, offering finer control, the digital display, and, most importantly, an even greater range of sizes.While the old remote could shrink people down to an eighth of an inch, the new one could do 1/64\", accommodating multi-size play up to four levels, depending on the size that people wanted their living toys. A woman shrunken down to six inches to play as a giantess' dildo could actually have her own dildo. And that woman, at half an inch, could even have her own dildo, down to the point that the full-size woman might not even be able to see the smallest person in their multi-size orgy. Of course, the new remote also afforded all the same perks as the old one, including the near-invulnerability to injury, and the commensurate ability to stretch to otherwise impossible proportions.Paige put her hand down on the knob, and span it down as quick as she could to the absolute minimum size.Holly shrunk so quickly that Paige couldn't even se her reaction. In an instant, ever feature of her body, arms, legs, breasts, even head, everything that made her human, shrank to microscopic size. Her vagina, however, still had the dildo buried inside it, so it became hundreds of times larger than the rest of her body to accommodate. In an instant, she was reduced to nothing more than a flesh colored condom on the vibrator, so thin and tight that all its bumps and ridges were clearly visible.And Holly got to feel what it felt like to take a fifty foot cock. Without pain, without injury, only with pleasure that swallowed her whole.Oh, and with vibration. Paige turned it on to its max setting, and lay back in bed to masturbate again. Holly might not even be able to conceive of what was happening to her; Paige was honestly jealous, but she closed her eyes and tried to imagine that it was her instead, as she slowly slid the vibrator back inside her.Paige was still sensitive enough that it only took a few minutes, especially with the powerful vibrator at its max setting, before she reached another mind-bending orgasm, the dildo so deep inside her that it was almost tickling her cervix. As she squirmed across the bed, lost to the pleasure, she left it vibrating inside her, letting the living condom that was Holly feel the her goddess' pelvic muscles squeezing her all around.Then, with a sigh, the pleasure passed, and she finally returned to the real world. She turned off the vibration, pulled it slowly out of her tender pussy, and sized Holly back up to her full two-foot height. The first thing that came out of the tiny woman's mouth when she had lungs large enough to make a noise was a guttural, almost demonic moan. Paige couldn't imagine the world of pleasure she had just left, or how long those few minutes had seemed to her, but she could guess. She had spent literally weeks at a time as a condom on a horse cock, and it had felt like an eternity. Her life was divided into two halves, the time before and the time after that experience. But Holly had experienced it at one eighth the size. The difference must have been enormous.She couldn't wait to try it out herself some day. Would that farmer be okay with letting her... borrow the stallion again?Slowly, amidst all her pleasured moaning an gasping, Paige drew the dildo out of her shrunken lover. When it was finally free, Holly flopped onto her back, her limbs as mobile as wet spaghetti. Her mouth was gaping open, eyes staring blankly at the ceiling, chest heaving with ragged breaths. Paige watched her with fascination, love, and a little bit of jealousy, waiting for her to recover. When her breathing finally seemed normal, she asked, \"How was it?\"Holly finally looked her giantess, though her eyes seemed to have a hard time focusing at first. \"Holy shit,\" she breathed.\"Do you want more?\"\"Yes,\" the shrunken woman said, as emphatically as she could manage in her exhaustion.\"Anal?\"\"Yes,\" answered Holly immediately. A pause, then she asked, \"What do you have in mind?\"\"Just my finger,\" Paige answered, waving her right hand over Holly's face. \"How long do you think that was?'Holly took a deep breath, thinking. Paige knew immediately that it had felt like days to her, but she was guessing based on how long she thought Paige could have gone for. \"An hour...\" she guessed.\"Three minutes.\"\"Fuck,\" the tiny woman breathed. \"We can do all day if you want.\"\"For anal?\"\"For anal.\"Holy only had to think about it for a moment. An anal orgasm was a hard thing to achieve, but it was worth it. With what Paige was about to do to her, though, it would be inevitable, and, more importantly, it would come without a trace of the discomfort that came at full size.\"Yes.\"Paige nodded in response. She slid her middle two fingers into her still-sensitive vagina to lubricate them; no point being squeamish about bodily fluids at this point; and Holly rolled obediently onto her belly, lifting her ass into the air, arcing her back, and waiting.Paige to put the tip of her ring finger against Holly's asshole, and, this time, pushed it in all the way as quick as she could.Holly let out a yell, but there was only shock in it, no pain. And that yell petered off into a moan of pleasure, and Paige could feel the shrunken woman's asshole squeezing her finger. The involuntary spasms of sexual excitement.Then Paige grabbed the remote. With a single spin of the knob, Holly was eight inches tall, and Paige's ring finger protruded all the way up to her chest. The shrunken woman couldn't even draw breath to gasp anymore, she could only watch, shock and pleasure written on her face in equal measure, as Paige continued to slowly shrink her down. As the bulge that was the giantess' finger traced upwards, into her throat, and then finally forced her jaw open wide and protruded from her mouth.The tiny woman's arms and legs hung limp, her torso completely skewered by Paige's ring finger. It was an amazing sight, but Paige wasn't done.She span the dial a few more times, until the display read \"1/64.\" Unlike when the dildo had been penetrating her, she was totally run through by Paige's finger, from her asshole to her mouth. So, as Holly shrank, she fell into the point where the giantess' finger penetrated her. Her arms and legs, every feature that made Holly who she was vanished into nothingness. And, in an instant, all that was left was a thin, delicate ring on Paige's hand. The bright white flesh was a nice contrast with her own skin color.Paige regarded her new piece of living jewelry for a moment. They made silicone rings that looked a lot like this; soft, unornamented, fairly unremarkable. Maybe with a microscope, someone could have identified the human features that this one bore, but, in the real world, nobody would think anything of it. Only even the most observant would even the subtle, twine-thin wrapping around her finger, and nobody would bother to ask her questions about it. Absolutely nobody would guess that it was actually her roommate, shrunken impossibly small, living in a universe of unlimited sexual pleasure.\n","Winnie was apparently a marathon runner. Becca was crushed with enough force to turn her bones to powder a million times, flying through the air each time the massive woman's leg came off the ground, then being slammed down under unbelievable weight when her foot made contact. There was nothing she could do to minimize it, to protect herself from it, or even to ready herself for it. Each stomp down was a new, fresh torture. She tried to count the steps, but each time the woman's body weight came crashing down on top of her was such a disorienting experience that she found it hard to keep count above the mid-30s. Lacking any reliable count, a watch, or any sign of what was going on outside her dark, sweat-drenched prison, Becca had nothing to time this nightmare with, and no reason to believe that she was not just trapped in an eternity of being crushed under Winnie's foot. It fucking felt like an eternity. Every time Winnie's foot came down felt like being punched in the gut, like someone was stepping on her toes, like taking a bat to the stomach, and like an airbag exploding in her face, all at once. And it happened over, and over, and over again. Until her gritted-teeth endurance gave way to desperation, and then to abject misery, tears streaking down her face as she begged an uncaring God for mercy. But, when even that failed, and she had no more tears left to shed, Winnie kept running.The somewhat steady rhythm of it finally allowed Becca to retreat into herself, once she had finally worked her way to accepting the inevitability of the pain. It didn't help time go any faster, but it made the jarring, bone-shaking impact of each step somewhat less of a catastrophe that sent her emotions into a fresh spiral of despair. It was more of just... another thing... And there would be another that would follow after, and again, and again, and again...It wasn't a line of thinking she could spend very long exploring, though. The only way to deal with it was to accept the present, forget the past, and ignore the future. Everything else was pure misery, because her life was misery at that moment.But Winnie just kept running. Becca had to keep convincing herself that it would end soon... eventually... but maybe soon... but not now... but soon... maybe now? No, but soon, surely... Her body was basically fixed in place, arms and legs spread underneath the unyielding arch of the giantess' foot, but her mind was running on its own treadmill, trying to stay one step ahead of the soul-crushing misery of her life.Winnie's cardio endurance couldn't be longer than her sanity's endurance, could it? But this was an excruciating experience, every step was a test of her will to live, and, man, \"just a few miles\" had a lot of steps.But then, just like that, it was over. One time, the giantess' weight came off, just like every other time when sh was running, but, instead of slamming back down on her a second later, Becca felt a sudden, frigid wind of fresh air on her back. Winnie had slipped off her shoe and sock in a single motion, finally freeing the shrunken prisoner under her foot. The boiling hot, sweat-soaked flesh of the sole of her foot kept Becca's miniscule weight stuck to it for a moment, but she didn't have to fight to get free. Barely a second after the tight prison of the massive woman's running shoe had been stripped away, Becca tumbled to the ground far below, landing with what felt like a deafening thud on the ground, right next to the giantess' other foot.Her bare foot, she noticed. Winnie had chosen to take her other shoe off first, giving Becca just a few more moments of torture.Becca was ready to lie there forever, just try to recover from what had been an eternity of unwarranted punishment. But she was startled upright by the giantess' foot slamming back down to the ground right beside her; if she had fallen just a few feet to the right, she would have been stepped on again.She recognized the cheap carpet of the sorority house bedrooms. The light peeking in from behind the curtains was still the dim gray of early morning, illuminating the unusually pink and fluffy confines of Winnie's bedroom. For all her hard-edged scholarship and athleticism, the woman decorated her bedroom like the inside of a Hello Kitty store. Just a few feet away was a throw rug so plush that Becca would have been lost in the strands at her size.Winnie ignored Becca as she unzipped and stripped off her sports bra, freeing a chest that was slick with sweat. Then the running shorts hit the ground, then she slid off the compression shorts, making her way across the tiny room and losing an article of clothing with every step. The hairtie that kept her ponytail up was the last to go. Finally, bare naked, sweaty, and still breathing hard, she crashed onto her bed.Becca was happy to lay on the ground as the giantess lay on her bed, both of them recovering from the workout. But while Winnie just needed to catch her breath, Becca felt like she needed far, far more. Some ice cream, maybe a vacation. She almost let herself believe that it was over, but the prey instincts that had developed over her time as a shrunken woman reminded her that she was still in the predator's den. The door was shut and locked, she was too small to escape and had nowhere to hide. Winnie was less than five seconds away from stomping on her again, or eating her alive, or any one of a hundred tortures that she could subject Becca to at this sizeBut there was also nothing she could do about it. She could only wait; every second was a second that Winnie didn't spend torturing her, and a second closer to Winnie having to leave for class, hopefully leaving Becca alone and unattended in her room. So Becca lay there, listening as the giantess' breathing grew slower and more measured. Then, with groan, Winnie pushed herself upright; Becca's heart stopped, sure that the next torture was coming soon, but the naked woman just grabbed the water bottle off her endtable and started chugging. For some reason, Becca couldn't help but watch. Winnie was attractive, sure, but the thing that captivated her was the way that her throat moved and flexed as she downed the bottle of water. She could just imagine being trapped in that bottle, riding down the rapidly descending water level, unable to escape her inevitable descent into the giantess' mouth. Then all it would take would be one swallow...She shook herself. What the hell was she thinking? After all that time hating life under Winnie's foot, why was she fantasizing now about being eaten alive?Winnie drained the bottle, which probably didn't have any shrunken human beings in it, and set it back on the nighstand. She didn't fall back into bed, though, but her eyes fixed right on Becca. Fear gripped the shrunken woman, not certain what was coming next but sure that it would be bad. Winnie crossed her right leg over her left knee and rubbed at the sole of her foot. \"That was less fun than I thought it would be.\"\"It wasn't fun for me either,\" Becca muttered. But she was too small to be heard from that far away, and Winnie wasn't looking for her opinion anyway. \"I think you gave me a blister,\" Winnie continued. It sounded like an accusation. It sounded like something that she would contrive a punishment for Becca having done to her, even though she did it to herself.\"I guess it seemed more fun in my head,\" Winnie concluded. She put her foot back down and stretched like a kitten, arms over her head and eyes screwed shut. Then she fell backwards onto her bed again, bare legs dangling over the side.“We can still have a litlle fun...” Winnie offered. Becca couldn't see the woman's entire body, but she did see her hand reach down between her legs for a quick, exploratory rub. Becca's breath froze in her throat, dreading what might come next. But, after a few seconds, Winnie apparently decided against whatever 'fun' she had in mind, and said, with a frustrated sigh, \"Nevermind, no time.\"The giantess might be frustrated, but Becca was relieved. Having decided that their time was over, Winnie kicked herself out of bed, taking a few short steps across the room to scoop a pink bathrobe off the floor. She draped it across her shoulders and wrapped it tight around her waist, then stepped back over to Becca. Now barely decent but still with a surprising amount of her chest and legs showing, she loomed overhead, as if having second thoughts about deciding not to use the shrunken woman as a sex toy.Winnie had been bare naked, from head to toe, just a second ago. But now she was wearing at least something, and the way that Becca could still see up the hem of the robe to the sensitive flesh between the massive woman's legs somehow seemed naughtier, more intimate than just seeing her naked had been.\"Time for you to go back home,\" the giantess told her. And then she bent down, her head drawing frighteningly close, horrifyingly quickly, and her hand coming out of nowhere to snatch Becca off the carpet. Her fingers went from distant abstractions to massive, fast-moving snakes, closing around her body with unrelenting force. Becca had to fight the urge to recoil, or even to scream in panic. Even after all this time enduring these sudden assaults, the urge never went away, it just became a bit easier to suppress.Once Becca was ripped off the floor and sent flying through the air, swinging wildly at the side of a giantess draped in terrycloth, it only took a minute, maybe two, before she was back under her impromptu glass prison. But it was a chaotic minute. It felt like Winnie was being intentionally violent about moving her, her limbs flailing around like ropes. Her view of the world span and blurred with every step, with only brief pauses for her to identify where she was. The bedroom, the doorway, the hallway, the stairs, the common area...And then she hit the ground... no, the table... and then... thunk. All fell still. She was back under the upturned pint glass, the hefty weight of her size remote on top of her, making sure that she wouldn't go anywhere unless a giantess wanted her to.And it would be a giantess. It would always be a giantess. She was in a sorority house. Her sorority house. The place where she thought that she had developed close, personal friendships. Where she thought she had found besties for life, earned over laughs, tears, and more than a few drinks. But all of them had turned on her the moment that she had a remote controlling her size. Overnight, she had gone from sister into good standing to... well...She had become exactly what she had thought that Holly was, when she had first shown up at the house.\"Hey there.\"Becca twisted to identify the source of the voice, and was surprised to see Suzy, of all people, standing over the table behind her. The Sisterhood Vice President of the sorority was dressed in pretty standard clothes for a trip to class: mid-thigh jean shorts, with the cuffs rolled up once or twice, a t-shirt in the garish school colors, and a backpack that dangled off her left forearm, one of the zippers wide open.Suzy was the pure, innocent one, right? The one who still went to church? The woman who blushed like a nun caught staring too long at Michelangelo's David? Wrong. Suzy was the woman who attended back-room sex parties, who brought tiny women who they knew personally into their sorority house to be abused by a hundred other women. She was the biggest sexual deviant on the planet, and the rest of the world had no idea. Becca knew that it had only been one night. She had expected days of torture, with plenty of hours of being ignored, punctuated by minutes' long sprints of sexual abuse from the women she thought had been her friends. She did not expect that Suzy would drop her off, then return the next morning for whatever she had in mind.\"Did you have a good night?\" Suzy asked cheerily, all bubbles and smiles. Becca had to look around, and did not fail to notice that, at least from her perspective, she and the giantess were the only two people in the room. She hefted the backpack in Becca's direction. \"How about you come with me?\"The remote holding down Becca's prison disappeared, scooped up by Suzy's deft hand and tossed into the bottom of her open backpack. The giantess took a look in the open pocket of her bag, and then planted her hand on top of the glass that kept Becca imprisoned.Becca watched, seemingly in slow-motion, as the woman's hand flattened against the clear glass, palm against the base, fingers wrapping around the sides. It was like watching a sea monster's tentacles tighten around her bathysphere. And, as the fingers pressed down, flattening the textures of fingerprints into fleshy pads, she could imagine the glass shattering and imploding on her.And then the glass was gone. It seemed instant, and the fresh air hit Becca like a wall. A second later, Suzy's other hand slammed down on her, pinching her by the waist between thumb and forefinger, and hauling her high, high, high into the air.She flew, she soared, she fell. There was light, wind, noise, then darkness. Then a slam, an oof, and Becca was suddenly at the bottom of Suzy's backpack, her own size remote a bus-sized body right next to her. No, she prayed. Not like this. She needed to be somewhere else. If Suzy left her like this, the remote would bowl her over and rattle around inside the bag like the plastic ball inside a spraypaint can, pounding her tiny form to death. She raised her hand, about to scream her protest.But Suzy didn't even care. The zipper that closed overhead was louder than anything that came before. And, in an instant, all was dark.\n"],["I woke up completely underneath the blankets. It was dark, it was hot, and it smelled like parts of my body that I didn’t care to think about. I moved to bring the blankets down, but found that, no matter how far I reached in any direction, I couldn’t find the end of them. Something was wrong, but I couldn’t know what until I could see what was happening, so I began to crawl forward, hoping that there would be an end to the blankets soon.\nThe second I was free from the blankets, blinking in the bright sunlight that shone in through Renee’s bedroom windows, I realized that I had, inexplicably, shrunk. Her bed stretched out before me like a limitless plain, and her pillow towered over me like a mountain. Everything in her room seemed massive; I could scarcely be any taller than six inches now.\nIt was just then that I noticed the woman I had fallen asleep with, my roommate, Renee. She was shorter than me, but now she seemed a giantess. She stood by the side of my bed, donned in nothing but her underwear, and her hands were behind her back, working at the clasp of her bra. She was young and beautiful, with a strong, athletic figure despite her relatively short stature. She had once been a gymnast, but retained her lean muscle and powerful thighs even now. Despite my bizarre situation, my eyes lingered on her body, the massive columns of her legs supporting her broad, curvy hips. God, I had felt like the luckiest man in the world taking a girl like that to bed, but I didn't realize that there was apparently a catch.\nNow, garbed in only her silk underwear and towering high over my head, I got a full appreciation for exactly how strong she was. Smooth skin was stretched tight over well-toned muscle; what little body fat she had gave her strong, seductive curves in her hips and around her breasts, and smoothed the definition in her leg muscles.\nRenee finally undid the latch on her bra and let it fall to the floor. Her breasts sagged only slightly when released, hugging tight to her chest. “I’ve waited a long time for this,” she declared, looking down at me. I tried to avert my eyes, and she said. “No, you might as well look. It doesn’t matter now.”\nSo I looked. Her breasts hung down as she bent over to slide down her thong, and jiggled slightly as she shook her leg to kick it away. Her nipples were erect, and I couldn’t help but notice that she had shaved all her pubic hair off. With her feet askance, there was only a small space between where her thighs met her hips that I could see her labia, swollen and red. With the size of her leg muscles, she could have hidden her entire crotch by bringing her feet together, but she stood with her feet apart, hands on hips, proud of her body and looking down at me with a strange smile.\nWith a start I realized that I was naked as well, and sported a stark erection to boot. I scrambled to cover myself, and Renee almost laughed. She sat down on the bed beside me, and I nearly slid down into the deep impression her body weight made on my mattress. She sat with her back up straight, offering me a profile of her body as illuminated by the sunlight streaming in through the window. She was perfect, and the small irregularities on her otherwise smooth skin made her that much more beautiful.\nI had enjoyed the appearance of Renee’s body before, it was impossible not to, but I could have never imagined that her raw, naked body would look quite this good.\n“You won’t die,” she said to me, though she was looking up at the ceiling. Her breathing seemed unusually heavy. “Though you might not think that’s a good thing.”\nWith that, she swung her legs onto the bed, placing one on either side of me and presenting me with a line shot to her crotch. I only had a second to admire it from a distance before she brought her feet together around my body, clapping me between the smooth but tough soles of her feet, then drawing them towards her.\nI sped towards her crotch at what felt like a blistering pace, though her actual motion did not seem particularly quick. Still, in only a second, I was brought up face-to-face with her vulva, radiating heat and covered in a fine sheen of lubricant. My arms and legs were pinned together between her feet, and there was nothing I could do but stare at the mass of flesh folded on top of itself.\nShe slid her left hand down onto her crotch and, with her index and middle finger, slowly spread apart the lips. Textured pink flesh seemed to leap forward, exposing her clitoris and the tight, dark entrance to her vagina.\nMy fear had quelled my erection before, but it was back, and rock hard. I squirmed in discomfort, trapped between her feet, but I was powerless to resist whatever she wanted to do with me. Her feet only parted when her right hand came down and wrapped around my body, and my split-second opportunity to move was gone before I could even consider escaping. One moment, I was trapped between her feet, the next, her hand held my arms and legs together with even greater strength.\nShe pulled me forward and, as she raised her knees to lift her vulva further above the bed, she pressed the entire front of my body against her crotch, forcing me mercilessly against the soft, hot flesh. Her left hand was gone, now caressing her own breasts, and the folds of her vulva enveloped my body like quicksand. \nAnd, before I knew it, she had begun to slide me up and down. Scrubbing her vagina with the front of my body with all the cold, merciless strength that she would a sponge. Unlike so many of the women I had pleasured, back when my body was larger than a dildo, Renee did not seem fond of savoring the rise to climax; she abused my body, and her vagina, in a quick, businesslike manner.\nAnd it would have been fine if the force of her rubbing didn’t hurt so much. She pressed me against her crotch with such speed and force that, even with the lubricant, the heat was unbearable. The smell was overwhelming, and, every time I tried to gasp for a lungful of fresh air, I took in more fluid than oxygen. Also, without my hands to hold my erection to my body, it caught against every fold in her skin, bending around in a way pleasurable enough to be arousing, but not enough to bring me to orgasm.\nIt was torture, but the plus side to Renee’s cruel strength and speed was that she reached orgasm quickly. Her chest heaved, and her left hand fell behind her to prop her up. She scrubbed me against her crotch with even greater rapidity, if that was possible, and I could feel the powerful pelvic muscles that wrapped around her vagina contracting, pushing her vulva forwards and forcing the soft, hot flesh to well up around me.\nBut her climax was no reprieve. I knew it came because I felt her entire crotch squeeze forward against the front of my body, and a new fluid, opaque white and sticky, came from the depths of her vagina to mix with the lubricant that surrounded me.\nI heard her rattling gasp, and her legs snapped together. The strength of a gymnast’s thighs immediately squeezed full force around her hand and my body. Muscles and tendons I didn’t even know existed pushed at me from all sides, seeking to crush me. I don’t know how they didn’t kill me.\nWhen Renee’s orgasm finally passed, she lifted me into the air, right in front of her eyes. Her face was flushed, and she was breathing like she had just run a mile. Even after being treated to a front-row view of her vagina during orgasm, she still seemed stunningly beautiful. “Let’s see how invincible you are,” she said.\nThen she placed me between her thighs, just a few inches away from her crotch. She wasn’t flexing, I knew because her flesh still yielded somewhat when I pressed against it. Her hand came away, leaving me trapped between her thighs. Perhaps, if I wriggled just right, I could...\nAnd then she squeezed. She squeezed with force like I couldn’t even imagine. It could have killed me even if I had been full-sized. That it didn’t immediately crush me like a ripe grape was astounding, but I felt like it should have. I couldn’t breathe, I could only hear the sound of the blood pumping in my ears, but, through the haze, I could see the vicious smile on her face.\nThen she began to rub her thighs together, the same way one rubs their fingers together to destroy a spot of grease. If the clenching of her thigh muscles didn’t destroy me, this surely should have. I was twisted and rolled around, contorted into painful shapes, and all the while compressed between the vice grip of her thighs. The tiny amount of lubricant that had spread from her crotch to the inside of her thighs was the only thing that kept this process from tearing me limb from limb.\nIt only lasted a few seconds, but it felt like forever. Afterwards, Renee plucked me from between her thighs and held me upside-down by my legs above the bedsheets, studying my fluid-soaked body curiously.\n“I’m impressed,” she said. “Well, get ready, because that was just the beginning.”\n","\"I'm impressed,\" Renee said, her voice deafening at her massive size. She held me upside-down between thumb and forefinger, and my inverted visage of her face seemed to fill my entire world. \"Well, get ready,\" she said, her voice clear even through the viscous layer of lubricant that coated my head, \"Because that was just the beginning.\"\nI barely had the energy to groan. Renee shifted her hand so that she held my legs fast together, then brought me down to her crotch. Instead of pressing me against her clitoris again, however, she leveled me out with both hands, resting my head against the wet folds of flesh between her legs.\nFor a second, I was offered a view of tons and tons of smooth, toned skin leading up to the underside of her breasts, and then she pushed, and I slid into her vagina with almost no resistance.\nIt was dark, incomparably hot, and incomprehensibly smelly. Every breath I took brought in more fluid than air, but, besides the feeling of mixed lubricant and ejaculate sliding down my throat, there didn’t seem to be a difference. Renee forced me all the way into her vagina, until my head hit the tight opening to her cervix at the end.\nThe walls of her vagina wrapped around me like a living, throbbing latex glove, pressing against every curve of my body. When that elastic force wrapped around my cock, it was the most satisfying thing in the world, but, now, it was suffocating, it was terrifying, but it was also the most erotic thing I had ever experienced.\nNo sooner had my head struck the bottom of Renee’s vagina did she begin to pull me back out again. My entire body, all the way up to my neck, squeezed out of her vagina, and then she pushed me back in. My erection was bent painfully far downwards by my reinsertion, and kept there as I was dragged out again, but the sensation was the closest thing to intercourse I could hope for, and, slowly but surely, I could feel the pleasure mounting.\nAided by the seemingly limitless flow of lubricant from the walls that wrapped around me, I slid bodily in and out of Renee’s vagina with just as little resistance as my penis would have. And, then, in the first step towards climax, her pelvic muscles squeezed.\nHad I been the one fucking her, the sensation would have just been a pang of pleasure around my cock. But, as I was buried upside-down, all the way to my ankles, in her vagina, the pelvic muscles of a gymnast wracked my body with pain as they turned the walls that surrounded me rock-hard.\nIt was only for one split-second, but it felt as if she had placed me in the palm of her hand and clapped. It forced the air from my lungs, and, when the giantess’ womanly muscles relaxed, I gasped in pain, taking in a lungful of slippery lubricant and sticky ejaculate.\nAnd that was only the first of many contractions. At first, Renee would have to drive me deep into her vagina nearly thirty times before another contraction wracked my body and hers alike. But, with time, they grew more and more frequent, until every third penetration was accompanied with a painful, enduring squeeze on every inch of my body.\nI had long since orgasmed from the stimulation, and my pathetic squirt of semen had long since been lost to the oceans of vaginal lubricant. I was no longer aroused, but terrified. I hadn’t lasted this long, not by a long shot. How on earth was she doing it? Was she fighting the orgasm? What would happen when it finally came? When she finally came?\nI would find out soon enough. Eventually, nearly every time I was squeezed through the vice grip of her vagina, Renee would have to forcefully extract me from the power of the contraction that grabbed at my body. But lubricant helped, and, even though I felt like I was being forced through rollers, the giantess persisted.\nAnd, finally, Renee forced me so powerfully and so deep into her vagina that my head was driven against her cervix, and she climaxed. High above my head, she screamed, her back arcing, her legs shaking, her toes curling, her hands grabbing futilely at her thighs as clear fluid shot from her crotch. But all I experienced was a contraction that made my torture between her thighs feel like child’s play. An enduring, powerful contraction that forced the walls of the woman’s vagina to clench around me like a hand crushing a hard-boiled egg.\nThe orgasm soon subsided, though Renee left me buried in her vagina for the whole set of contractions that came with it. Each came later than the one before, but was just as strong as the first, and each caused her entire body to shake. Soon enough, though, the hand wrapped around my feet again and, unbelievably, the massive woman began again.\nShe tore me in and out of her vagina even faster than before, and the contractions came with greater frequency than they did the first time. The flesh around me was a pink blur, powerful muscles ravaging my body. I was never pulled out far enough to see the bright light or taste the fresh air of the outside, though at times I could feel that only my head was wrapped in the elastic flesh of the giantess’ vagina.\nRenee had her feet behind her head, her left hand massaging her clitoris as her right hand moved with lightning speed, ripping me in and out of her vagina with speed that should have definitely killed me.\nHer next orgasm came quicker, and it hurt even more than the first. But it passed just as quickly, and before I knew it, Renee was pumping her vagina furiously again, working her way to a third orgasm.\nShe was strong and she was merciless. After her second orgasm, she took her time working her way to her third, occasionally leaving me buried all the way to my ankles in her vagina just before she would have climaxed, subjecting me to a long, bone-crushing set of declining contractions, then starting the furious penetration again. Sometimes, she slowed down, quickly dragging me out of her vagina, slamming me back in, then leaving me buried deep, with my head pressed against her cervix, as a powerful squeeze of her pelvic muscles emptied my lungs and forced my arms and legs together.\nForced that deep into her vagina, with nothing but my feet sticking out, only my head escaped the ravages of her contractions. The walls of her vagina clenched tight everywhere but in the tiny space around her cervix. But that meant that all the fluid that had built up on the walls was forced upwards to fill the tiny cavity. The hot, slippery, translucent white mix of bodily fluids completely submerged my head. Sometimes, the contractions were so enduring, holding my head under this salty fluid for so long, that I could not help but take a lungful.\nAnd yet I didn’t drown. I almost wished I could have, just to be released of this sexual torture. Renee’s first orgasm had taken almost half an hour to reach, her second no more than five minutes. But she skated on the edge of her third for an hour, two hours, maybe more. It felt like an eternity.\nHow could she stand it? Being that close to climax for that long? She must enjoy torturing me more than the actual sexual pleasure. At this point, the halt in motion of her orgasm would have been a welcome respite, the body-breaking contractions of her herculean pelvic muscles notwithstanding.\nOr so I thought. I was halfway into Renee’s vagina, buried all the way to my thighs but with most of my legs sticking out, when I felt the distinctive powerful, rhythmic contractions of her orgasm. This time, my head was not spared, and the elastic walls around me turned to stone against my face, seeking to crush my skull. I could feel the pressure in my very ears. My joints cracked as they were twisted together by a crushing force that even her legs could not have matched.\nAnd, just as soon as the muscles around me relaxed, they squeezed tight again, with only a brief second between for me to gasp in pain and prepare for the next contraction. I could hear Renee’s racing heartbeat through the elastic walls around me, and, when the contractions came, her vagina pushed so close that I could feel her pulse against every inch of my skin.\nEventually, the contractions grew weaker and less frequent. Renee’s hand wrapped around my legs and finally tore me all the way out of her vagina, flinging me down onto my bedsheets, which had been darkened by the fluid of her orgasms. As I lay there, coughing up my lungful of all the fluids that her body had submerged me in, I saw that Renee had wound up with her legs behind her head. Her entire body shook from the aftermath of the orgasm, and she untangled her legs to bring herself up to her knees, scooting forward until her thighs towered over each side of me. Heavy, viscous drops of lubricant formed on the lips of her vagina and fell down to the bed, some landing on me.\n“You’re still alive?” she asked, shocked and breathless. Her face was flushed, and red scratch marks were on the backs of her thighs. Her skin from the waist down glistened with fluid, as well as parts of her upper body that she had grasped at with her free hand. There was a very clear handprint on her left breast.\n“Definitely worth what I paid for,” she said aloud, as if there was someone else in the room who could hear her. A pause, then “Well, Tentacious, you win. Hope you like your new home, little guy.”\nWith that, she reached down and grabbed me again, lifting me all the way to her mouth. She stuck my head and shoulders between her lips, then pushed me in slowly with her finger. When all but my feet was in her mouth, my head so deep as to be staring down the dark maw of her throat, she pulled me back out, sucking her own vaginal fluids off every inch of my skin on the way out.\nI wasn’t dry when I was back in the open air; lubricant had merely been replaced with spit, but it was good enough. Still, it didn’t seem like I would be clean for long, as Renee widened her split a little and brought be back down between her legs.\nThis time, I went into her vagina feet-first, and slowly. The glistening lips parted readily at my presence, and hungrily consumed my lower legs, my thighs, my waist, all the way up to my chest as Renee pushed me in by my head with just a single finger.\n“You’re going to be in there for a long time,” I heard her say, though all I could see was the perfectly smooth skin of her inner thighs and the well-lubricated flesh of her vagina all around me. “Maybe you’ll live long enough for me to use you again.”\nWith that, she pushed me the rest of the way in, until my feet bottomed out and almost my entire body was buried in her vagina. Even after her sexual exercise, my body was still longer than her vagina, and, with her legs spread wide, my entire head was still out in the open air, though my view was limited to her inner thighs, her labia, and the pelvic mound that led up to her stomach. It was a view I would have paid anything for not that long ago.\nShe brought her feet back together as she stepped off my bed. Her legs were large enough that the tops of her thighs folded over her vulva no matter how she stood, unless her legs were spread completely apart. It meant that her massive thigh muscles closed over my head, pressing as mercilessly around my skull as the walls of her vagina did around the rest of my body, and darkening my view of what she was doing.\nEvery now and then, she shifted a little so that I could see out. I got a glimpse of Renee’s room as she bent over to pick up her clothes, and a completely unimpeded view of her sliding her thong up her legs, right up to the point where the soft cloth pressed up against my face, coloring everything a pink hue. And then the world went dark as she got her jeans on. When she stood up, I was suspended completely upside down, but neither gravity nor the gallons of lubricant that surrounded me helped me slide downwards. I writhed back and forth to gain a little purchase, hoping to slither my way out of her vagina, but a single gentle squeeze of her vaginal muscles, nowhere near the full force that had wracked my body before, pulled me all the way back in. \nDespite my humiliating position, despite the pouding of Renee's heartbeat and the squelching of the flesh that surrounded me, I could hear her voice quite clearly. \"Well, that's it for me. Hope you enjoyed the show, see you next time!\"\n","And so Renee went about her daily business, with me trapped helpless in her vagina. I could hear her speak every once in a while, but her voice was too muffled for me to make anything out. The lubricant slowly dried out, eliminating what little chance of escape I had, and the walls of her vagina, expanded from hours of sexual abuse, began to close back together, trapping me ever tighter.\nWhen the woman sat down, I felt her vulva  squishing up around me, the hard seat pressing up against my face. When she crossed her legs, her thigh muscles bundled around the front of her crotch and pushed me even deeper. When she slept, she kept her legs too close together for me to even try escaping. I could feel every step she took, and her vagina, with me trapped inside, shook with the swaying of her hips.\nShe rode a bicycle to class, the bike seat pushing up between her legs with every bounce, which pushed my feet against her cervix. She played volleyball, apparently, gyrating and jumping so enthusiastically that it took a little squeeze of her vagina every few seconds to hold me in. She even masturbated once, riding the washing machine until she orgasmed so hard that she fell off, and subjecting me to every little texture of her climax.\nIt was days before I finally saw the light of the outside world again. I never grew hungry, never grew thirsty, never seemed to need a breath of real air, and, unfortunately, never grew sleepy. It meant long, boring nights where even my most furious attempts to escape would only give her whatever the female equivalent of a wet dream was. I learned quickly not to move too much when she finally fell asleep; it was far too easy to bring her to orgasm, and far too difficult to wake her up. Her vaginal muscles were already inclined to twitch slightly while she dreamt, but making the mistake of pleasuring Renee in her sleep would bring untempered, bone-crushing clenches.\nAnd, when she pulled me out for the first time, it wasn’t even to use me as a sex toy. She grabbed my head by her finger and thumb and pulled me out fairly quickly. She was naked, and sopping wet from the shower. I hadn’t even noticed that she was in the shower. I just took the scrubbing and pressing over the front of her vagina to be another quick attempt at pleasuring herself.\nShe held her phone out at arms length, and I saw in my brief glimpse of the screen that she was recording video. Despite the shocking light and cold of the outside world, I still had the presence of mind to realize how weird that was. What was she filming this for? Was there a chance that someone would see it, recognize me, and save me? I tried my best to gesture to the camera for help, but she moved me around too fast, her grip shifting on my body to pin my arms to my sides, squeezing so hard that I couldn't breathe. In a few short seconds, she held me just below her hips, forcing me to stare up at the dark, wrinkled cleft between her legs. \n“I think he's tired of being upside-down,” she said aloud. Was it to the camera? Then, in a sudden, nauseating motion, she fell into a deep crouch. The lips of her labia parted as she did so, revealing the bright pink flesh underneath.\nA new pair of panties were halfway up her shins, and she carefully lay me in the center of them, presenting me with an ant’s-eye view of her beautifully-formed body from her legs to her breasts. The phone was still there, and I could clearly see myself, sprawled awkardly in the cotton hammock of her underwear.\nAnd then she pulled the panties all the way on before I could react. One second, I was laying face-up on the stitched gusset of her panties, the next, my face was buried in the flesh of her crotch. The odor was overwhelming, the heat oppressive. And, when she stood up, her vulva tightened up, and her panties wedgied into a cameltoe, trapping me between her labia.\nAfter that, Renee went about her business once again. I didn’t realize how sheltered I was from the ravages of her daily activities inside her vagina until now. Every time she sat, her full weight pressed tons and tons of hot flesh around me. When she biked, the seat seemed to be willfully pressing me into her body. When she exercised, the heat doubled and the odor of sweat was almost as strong as the odor of her vagina.\nI only earned reprieve when she stripped her panties to go to the bathroom, and, even then, she planted her foot down on me to prevent me from escaping, and then it was back into the folds of her crotch I went.\nThe next time she switched my position, she put me underneath the back string of her thong, burying me deep between the cheeks of her ass. Facing away from her asshole, thank god, but every step she took pushed those powerful muscles together around me. And, sometimes, she would flex just for the fun of it, crushing me with a power unrivaled by anything I had been subjected to when she had been having sex with me.\nAnd, another time, she slid me between her breasts before putting on a tight sports bra and going for a run. The sweat poured around me, and, even with the sports bra, I was still bounced around uncomfortably with every step.\nBut the majority of my time was spent inside Renee’s vagina. For a full two weeks, she never once masturbated with me again, though she did use the washing machine once more and, twice, shoved the showerhead between her legs until she climaxed.\nSometimes, she wore long dresses without panties, and, when I was upside-down, I had enough of a view of the outside world to see her titanic legs stretching down to the ground far below, but little else, and, despite my writhing, I made no progress towards escape. Sometimes, she would punish my attempts by squeezing her pelvic muscles tight, pulling me all the way back inside her as she crushed me alive.\nIt was difficult to keep track of time, but I could count the number of times that the woman fell asleep. It was fully a month after she first slid me into her vagina that something finally changed, besides my position. For her period, she had slid me between her ass again. My best chance for escape had been then, when she was sleeping, but Renee apparently slept on her back. Even if I had managed to work my way out from between her glutes, I would have found myself trapped beneath all of her weight.\nBut, about a week after her period had passed, I felt her vagina lengthen somewhat, and fluid began to eke from the walls. A gentle squeeze of her pelvic muscles pulled my head under, depriving me of my view, but I could tell that she had lay down.\nThe lubricant was all but flowing from the walls around me now, filling my mouth with a taste I had not experienced in weeks. I felt Renee’s vagina shift in a way that meant she had just lifted her legs up and spread them wide, and then her fingers came down to her crotch and picked the lips of her vagina apart, letting in light.\nThe first thing that I saw was the massive pink tongue another of my roommates, Kristi. Did she know I was here? Ignoring the stunning revelation that the two women were lesbians, if she found out where I was, she could help me. I tried to shout, but the elastic walls surrounding me clenched tight, cutting me off before I could even inhale.\nThe contraction pushed me forward, forcing my head and shoulders out of Renee’s vagina. Kristi, whose longer, paler face was right in front of me, didn’t even look surprised. Her head came down again and her mouth closed around me, her tongue working its way between my chest and the walls of Renee’s vagina. Another contraction pushed me further out, and the tongue worked its way down to my waist. It curled between my legs, then pulled me completely out of Renee's body.\nShe was surprisingly dextrous with her tongue. With my body all the way down to my knees in Kristi’s mouth, the tongue worked its way across my torso like it was a living organism, slavering my body with spit but also removing Renee’s smelly, salty natural lubricant.\nThen Kristi grabbed my feet and plucked me out of her mouth. For the first time, I saw her naked body. She was less tan, but more slender than Renee, and her body showed somewhat more definition. It was clear that she was well-muscled, but there was even less fat on her than there was on Renee. There was a space between her legs, even when her feet were together, and I could see that her vulva was clean-shaven as well. Her skin was soft and fair, and her slender stomach, well-rounded breasts, and smooth crotch showed no sign of tan lines.\nRenee was on her back on her bed, her legs spread wide, and Kristi was kneeling just in front of her. Kristi surveyed me for a second, holding me upside down, then leaned forward and brought me back between Renee’s legs. She placed her left hand on Renee’s waist, and she rubbed my head up and down the thoroughly-lubricated outside of Renee’s vagina, tantalizing the sensitive flesh with my body. I heard a soft moan come from one of the two woman, then Kristi set my head against the opening to Renee’s vagina, and pushed me in.\nShe had a firm grip on my legs, though her hand only grasped up to my knee. She forced me in as deep as she could while maintaining her grip, and I was stunned to find that my head bottomed out, striking the giantess’ soft cervix. The walls even seemed to grip me tighter, though Renee’s pelvic muscles were still relaxed. Had I grown larger? Did these women have the power to control my size?\nI didn’t get the chance to follow that train of thought for too long, however, because, no sooner did my head strike the mucous-covered entrance to Renee’s womb did Kristi began pumping my body in and out of her lover’s vagina. She ripped me in and out with savage force and unbelievable speed, striking Renee’s cervix with my head so hard that it even hurt me, then tearing me almost all the way back out again, with nothing but my neck still inside the massive woman’s vagina.\nI was fully penetrating Renee twice a second, moving so fast that I could barely tell when her vaginal muscles were contracting. But the speed was lifting her to orgasm quickly, and her vagina did squeeze tight, both trying to deny me access and hold me in. But Kristi was relentless, and forced me in and out of Renee’s body that, despite the lubricant and despite the contractions, every fold and feature of her vagina was moving back and forth with me.\nThe orgasm still took ten minutes for Renee to reach, and, when it came, Kristi didn’t even give her a moment to breathe. She did slow down, but, instead, she started twisting. She turned me back and forth as she pushed me in and out, making the same motion that she would with a screwdriver. I was only moving half as fast, my head striking, and then twisting into Renee’s cervix only every second or so, but it was even more torturous.\nThe twisting exposed every side of my body to the strength of Renee’s vaginal contractions. Normally, there was a way that I could face that better accommodated the shape of her vagina, but, with the twisting, there was no such relief. A squeeze would crush me, and then I would be turned into it, my legs and arms twisting around as my body was exposed to the strongest axis of the contraction, then turned back.\nRenee was unprepared for this new motion, and her second orgasm only took two minutes. It seemed like forever, and, when it came, Kristi held me still, buried so far into Renee’s vagina that her cervix dilated and wrapped hungrily around the top of my head. I was forced to ride out the contractions, which came with every one of her rapid heartbeats and didn’t seem to lessen in strength for a full sixty seconds.\nKristi had only released me because Renee had forced her hand away, bringing her legs together to stop the other woman from continuing to penetrate her so that she could savor this orgasm. It took a while, but, when it was finally finished, it was Renee who grabbed my legs and pulled me out of her vagina.\nAnd, when she did, I saw that Kristi was lying on her back now, her head on the pillow and her legs raised up. Renee was standing on her knees when she pulled me out, and swung me about as carelessly as if I were a lifeless toy as she switched positions. She swung one leg over Kristi’s head, then settled down, pushing her crotch against Kristi’s face as she leaned forward, carrying me down the length of Kristi’s body as she did so.\nRenee wrapped one arm around Kristi’s left thigh, pulling it even further to the side, then brought me down between Kristi’s legs. I had one last view of Renee’s face, biting back the pleasure of Kristi exploring her crotch with her tongue, then I was plunged deep into the hot darkness of Kristi’s vagina.\nThe other woman’s insides had a different texture, a different color, a different strength. If anything, the elastic walls seemed to clutch at my body with even greater force. Her vagina was deeper; Renee was able to push me in all the way down to my shins before I struck the quivering, mucous-covered cervix at the end. I was pushed up against it and then left there for a second, feeling the fluid flowing over my skin, the heartbeat pressing through the walls, and then Renee began to penetrate her lover with my body.\nThe speed was unbelievable. Before I knew what was happening, I was out, then in, out and in, out and in, faster than the time it took to describe it. My body filled Kristi’s vagina, and then was gone in a split second, letting the elastic walls close back together with a squishing sound. I penetrated the giantess with unparalleled speed, force, and depth, Renee’s hand moving back and forth against Kristi’s vagina faster than I would have thought safe for her.\nNeedless to say, Kristi was brought to orgasm by my body faster than would have been possible even with a machine. Her muscles squeezed tight, pushing up against my body and pressing my limbs together, after no more than a few seconds. And, before the contraction had even subsided, I had been torn in and out of the massive woman’s vagina twice. Renee was unfazed by the resistance her lover’s pelvic muscles offered her, and had no care for my body as she whipped it back and forth. \nThe next contraction came right on the heels of the first, and the next came even faster. It wasn’t long before, at the speed with which I was torn in and out of that woman’s vagina, it didn’t even seem that the contractions were discrete anymore. And, not long after that, Kristi’s orgasm finally came.\nIt was only then that I knew what a full-bodied orgasm actually felt like. I was in the giantess as deep as I could go, my head pressed against her cervix and with fluid flowing all around, and then the muscles around me squeezed together with unbelievable force.\nI felt the hand tug at my legs again, but, for the first time, I didn’t move. I couldn’t. Neither of the women would have been able to crush me so completely with any other part of their body. Even putting me under heel and pressing down with all their weight would have felt pleasant compared to this. Muscle turned rock hard, elastic flesh bundled up around every curve of my body, and lubricant flowed rapidly to escape the collapsing voids that it filled.\nThe only thing I could feel through the contraction was Kristi’s heartbeat. As quick as a rabbit’s, but powerful enough that I could feel it pressing up against my skin even through the tons and tons of flesh that wrapped around me, crushing me.\nEventually, the contraction finally subsided, and Renee tore me out of Kristi’s vagina before another one could follow. Then she took the front of my body and rubbed it savagely up and down across Kristi’s soaking, seizing crotch. My face was pressed against the hot, soaking flesh as each contraction made it bunch up forward and press around my body. Her clitoris retracted into its hood with a contraction, then slapped against my chest with the release. The muscles of her vagina pushed outward, letting out a squirt of lubricant onto my face, then fell back into a deep, dark maw.\nAnd there was no rest. As soon as Kristi stopped writhing underneath Renee’s weight, her legs stopped kicking and her pelvic muscles stopped contracting, Renee leveled me out, pressed my head against the woman’s vagina, then pushed me back in, once again beginning the savage process of bringing her lover to orgasm.\nThe two women continued at this for longer than I could believe possible. Renee brought Kristi to orgasm dozens of times, and Kristi, in turn, explored her lover’s genitals with her tongue. I, on the other hand, was plunged in and out of Kristi’s vagina over and over again, then rubbed furiously between her legs as she rode out another climax.\nEventually, both women rolled onto their back on the bed, gasping in exhaustion. Renee still had her hand wrapped tight around my body, rubbing it idly up and down her stomach.\n\"I think he's all tuckered out, you guys,\" Renee said. Who was she talking to?\n“Give him to me,” Kristi said. Renee obligingly passed me into Kristi’s hand, who spread her legs wide, and, holding my legs together with two fingers, pushed me headfirst into her vagina.\nShe did it slowly, and yet it still elicited a small but powerful squeeze from her pelvic muscles. I could hear the squelching as the wet, elastic walls absorbed my body, see the lubricant welling up and pouring out as my body displaced it. Soon, everything but my feet were inside her, and my head was pressed up against her cervix. I was in as deep as I could go.\nAnd, with that, she sat up, cross legged, on the bed. Her vagina was directly underneath her, and my feet were being pushed into the blankets as the weight of her body pressed down on me. She slid back and forth, clearing lubricant from between her legs and shifting me around inside her vagina.\n And then she stood up again. Kristi had a gap between her legs when she stood, just wide enough that I could feel the cool air blowing around my ankles. Just enough space for me feel the cloth of her panties as she slid them on, feel it slowly growing moist as it absorbed the fluids that dripped down the walls around me. And, with that, Kristi went around her day, with me trapped inside her vagina.\n","It took some time before Kristi even bothered to touch me again. Days, even weeks. It was impossible to figure how much timen passed while trapped head-to-toe in the giantess' vagina. Her heartbeat pounded out an irregular rhythm, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, depending on what she was doing. Her body moved with frenetic energy sometimes, then held still for hours at a time. The oppressively boring nature of her pussy combined with the chaotic variations in the rhythms of her body made it impossible to figure out the passage of time. \nAll I knew is that it had been less than a month, and I only knew it because she hadn't had her period yet. I imagined, though I couldn't know for sure, that it would be abundantly obvious to me when she started menstruating. After all, I was buried bodily inside her vagina, within arms reach of her cervix. I had no idea what her period would look like from this perspective, but I was sure that it would be obvious when it happened. \nI wasn't looking forward to it; this woman's body was disgusting enough already. I had spent this entire time breathing the heady stench of her pussy, sucking down frothy lubricant with every breath, feeling the slimy touch of hot flesh against every inch of my skin. I didn't really want to add blood dribbling from her womb to this miserable experience.\nI lived in fear of her period for the entire time I spent inside her. Every time she ran, I feared that it would shake something loose. Every time she lay down, I feared that she would fall asleep, and then wake up to a deluge of period blood. \nMy fears seemed to be unfounded. After some indeterminate period of time, I felt her fingers dig between her legs, grabbing me by the ankles and dragging me abruptly into the outside world. The sudden transition from the dark heat of her body to the blinding light and chilling cold of the outside world was overwhelming. I struggled for a moment in her grip before I was able to gain my bearings.\nI was hanging upside-down in front of Kristi's face, at a level with her stunning blue eyes. It took a moment, though, before I realized that those eyes weren't even looking at me. They were focused on something else, something behind me. I tried to twist around to see what it was, but I couldn't really get that kind of control while dangling by my ankles.\nShe was on a bed, lying on her side, propped up on her elbow, stark naked except for a lacy black garter around her left thigh. Even though I was finally outside of her body, the heady, fishy odor of her pussy still tainted my every breath. I was coated head-to-toe in vaginal fluid, I would probably never escape the smell.\n\"He's kinda cute, isn't he?\" she asked. Who was she talking to? She shook me up and down a bit, an effortless flick of the wrist for her, but it threw my world into chaos for a moment.\nShe giggled. \"So what should I do with him?\"\nNobody answered her question, and I wondered for a moment if she was speaking, in some weird way, to me. And then I saw her eyes, looking beyond me, scanning something as if... reading? She was talking out loud, but someone was responding in text? I tried to twist to see what she was looking at, but still couldn't manage it.\nThen her grin split wide and she lifted me up a bit further, tilting her head back. Her eyes were on me this time, and she asked, her voice deafening from so close, \"So how does my pussy taste, little man?\" She brought me down a little close, until all I could see were her lips. When she spoke, it was frightening to watch them move so quickly when they seemed so big. \"Mind if I have a taste?\"\nShe opened her mouth wide, and I let out a startled yelp watching the dark pit open up underneath me. Her toungue reached out, as if it was a living thing with a hunger of its own. I realized, staring down her throat, that she could eat me right now. She could swallow me whole, there would be nothing I could do about it, and nobody would care. Shit, whoever she was talking to was probably egging her on.\nThen she let me go. I was in freefall for a single, terrifying moment, then her mouth snapped shut around me. In an instant, I was plunged into heat and darkness, her tongue pushing up against my back and holding me against the roof of her mouth. My legs were still sticking out of her mouth, but her lips held them tight, pinning them together and creating an airtight seal. \nHer tongue pushed me up harder, and my ears popped as all the air was suddenly sucked out of her mouth. My lungs were drawn empty by the rapid pressure change, my mouth working futilely as I struggled to draw breath while held in a death grip between her tongue and the roof of her mouth. Her tongue worked expertly against my body, drawing off the sticky fluids that still coated my skin, mixing them with saliva and drawing them to the back of her throat. Then, with a tremendous, fleshy noise of her powerful throat muscles slamming together, she swallowed. \nI was still held in place by her tongue, but I had a front-row seat to her throat closing up and swallowing down the fluid, and I knew that I would be helpless in the face of that strength.\nThen a hot wash of air came up from her throat, and her mouth opened somewhat, letting out a satisfied \"ahhh.\" The sound was deafening in here, the wash of light from her lips parting was blinding, and the sudden return of air pressure made my ears pop again. It was so quick, so disorienting, that I didn't even realize that I was screaming until I was cut short by her tongue pressing me hard again against the roof of her mouth.\nHer tongue seemed to have a will of its own, and it was much stronger than I was. She rolled me over, between her teeth, into her cheek, then back onto her tongue again, face-down this time. It worked me further back, pulling me all the way into her mouth, until my head was dangling down her throat. I scrambled for purchase, trying to push away, but her tongue had absolute control over me, effortlessly blocking everything I tried to do. \nThen her tongue surged up and pushed me bodily out of her mouth. The cold air and the blinding light hit me like a brick wall, and it took a second for me to get my bearings. As I cleared the saliva from my eyes, I finally got a good look at who she was talking to. Or, rather, what she was talking to.\nFor one disconcerting moment, I saw me, dangling upside-down, my legs held between her thumb and forefinger. Then I realized that it was a video feed, recorded by a camera that sat on the desk. On the screen with the video feed, new messages scrolling through at an alarming rate, was a chatbox. I couldn't read much of it upside-down, but I did see one phrase repeated a lot. \"Swallow him.\"\nFuck.\n\"Mmm,\" Kristi said from behind me. \"He tastes pretty good. Should I eat him?\"\nThe response from the chat seemed to be overwhelmingly in favor of it. Fuck me, how many people were watching this? How many times had I already been a toy for her eager audience?\n\"I don't know...\" she said, swinging me around thoughtfully. \"Then I won't be able to play with him any more.\"\nYes, don't listen to them. It seemed like I was immortal, but the last thing I wanted to do was test that inside her intestines. I had a terrible image of dying in the darkness of her stomach, gasping for air, stomach acid burning through my skin.\nA notification popped up on the screen. I couldn't make out what it said, but it prominently displayed a dollar value. It seemed like quite a lot. \nKristi laughed an airy laugh, \"Fine, you win, stubborn stain.\" She flipped me around, looking me in the eyes. \"How about you, little guy? Do you want to be my dinner?\"\nWhat the fuck did it matter what I thought? She was just milking these idiots for money, and I wasn't going to make a show of struggling for them. She didn't really wait for a response, though. She just shrugged and said, \"Maybe a little seasoning first.\"\nHer legs parted and her hips tilted until her ass was on the bed. Then, in a nauseating blur of motion, she brought me down between her legs, pushing my entire body facefirst into the fleshy, pliant lips of her pussy.\nHer fingers at my back, she rubbed me mercilessly back and forth, up and down, working me between the lips of her labia and into the wet, pink flesh underneath. Once the front of my body was thoroughly coated in slimy lubricant, she placed her finger on my head and slid me, facefirst, into her vagina.\nThe pink, muscular flesh parted effortlessly, wrapping tight around my entire body down to my ankles. She didn't waste time, though. As soon as I was fully inserted, she grabbed my feet and pulled me back out, carrying me back up to her face coughing and sputtering.\n\"Make sure you struggle, little guy,\" she said. Then her mouth opened wide, her tongue reaching out and sliming up against the entire front of my body. I did struggle this time, primal fear seizing control of my body, telling me to fight to the end of my strength in the face of being swallowed alive.\nIt did nothing. She dropped me into her mouth and it closed down on me, and her tongue made a plaything of my entire body. She rolled me around, pushing me all around her mouth until I didn't even know which way was up anymore. Then she stopped, and I felt her moving around for a moment. Oh, please, don't swallow.\nShe opened her mouth, and the sudden light was blinding. Blinking away the slimy mix of saliva and lubricant, I found myself face-to-face with the camera. My last chance to escape. I reached out, trying to grab something to pull my way to freedom, and her mouth snapped shut again.\nNo, no, no, no, no. Her tongue pulled me back further into her mouth, and, without delay, her throat clamped down on my legs. In an instant, I was dragged helplessly into her throat, sliding slowly down the wet walls of her esophagus. Muscles worked at every part of my body, crushing pressure that was even more brutal than being inside her pussy, carrying me inexorably down to my fate in her stomach.\n","My trip down to Kristi's belly was short and painful, an overwhelming assault on all of my senses. Everything seemed to happen all at once, and it was over before I could even scream. It was probably only in memory that my brain organized everything into discrete events.\nThe muscles of her throat squeezed hard around my tiny body, forcing me down, down, down. I could hear her heartbeat pulsing through the fleshy walls, a deep, rapid thumping. I came to an abrupt, jarring stop, pressed in on all sides by flesh, and then her muscles squeezed again and sent me the rest of the way down. After a few seconds, I found myself in the dark, squirming pit of her stomach. Acid splashed at me from the twitching walls, but it didn't do more than make my skin tingle.\nThat was a depressing realization by itself. I could sit in the giantess' stomach forever without consequence. I thought, I feared, that being sent into Kristi's inside would be the end of me, that I would dissolve into her stomach acids and become food for her massive body. But, despite the deep-bodied panic that sent my limbs thrashing as she toyed with me, the thought that I would die was a kind of release. This nightmare of being her slave, waiting for her to get bored or horny enough to masturbate with me, would finally be over. Dying was a second favorite to the slim chance of escape offered by survival, but it was close.\nBut, as acid coated my skin with every movement of the massive woman's body, I realized that my situation was much more hopeless than mere death. I was truly immortal; I'd be stuck here until... What? Could I even pass into her intestines at this size? I didn't know enough about biology to say, but I knew that whatever came next could not be pleasant.\nIt seemed like she made money from making me miserable. For some reason, people were willing to pay to watch her sexual torture, and they paid a premium to tell her how best to abuse my tiny body. How on earth could she get away with what she was doing with that many people watching? This was rape. Shit, it was worse than rape, but there were people out there who paid to watch it happen.\nWithout warning, Kristi shifted. Gravity was suddenly in another direction, and I tumbled into my back, a slowly-growing puddle of acidic fluid sloshing after me. A bit of it splashed in my mouth, but, besides the sour taste making me gag a bit, it didn't do anything to me, an impolite reminder of my unwelcome immortality.\nI struggled to my feet, trying to figure out what she had done. The way the walls of her stomach writhed and squirmed all around me made it difficult to keep my footing. But, placing a hand on the densely-textured, pulsing walls, I steadied myself and tried to gain my bearings. Her esophagos, the tight hole I had passed through to get here, was on one side of me, and the funnel that led down to her intestines was on the other side. So she was lying on her back.\nThen, through the infinite flesh, I heard a pleasured moan. That was the piece that made sense of the puzzle. Lying on her back, her heartbeat so rapid that I could barely tell the beats apart, and now this. She was masturbating, and I was going to experience it from inside her stomach. \nAfter my time with Renee, I knew the rhythms of a woman pleasuring herself. I could picture it clearly in my mind, Kristi lying on the bed, her legs spread wide for the camera, attacking her clitoris with a will. There were probably hundreds of perverts out there too, masturbating along with her, thinking about me trapped inside her stomach.\nThe thought made me furious, and I kicked angrily at the walls around me. As if in response, Kristi's hips bucked, another gasp of ecstasy accompanying the motion, and her stomach rocked violently around me. I fell straight on my ass, and the motion of her body threw me up into the air, landing me facedown onto the wall of her stomach. \nHer body kept moving after that, making it impossible for me to get back onto my feet. Every time I tried, an unexpected surge would toss me right back to the ground, or whatever passed as the ground in this place. After the first five or six minutes, I stopped trying, and just rode it out, spread-eagled against the blazing-hot surface of her stomach. Acid splashed up from all directions, coating every inch of my skin, filling my nose and mouth, but it didn't even leave a mark.\nI could hear her, even from here. Her moans came quicker, grew more desperate. The motion of her body was more rapid, and reached a pace where it never really ceased. I was tossed relentlessly up and down, slamming painfully against the walls of Kristi's stomach with every surge of her hips. Acid completely soaked my body at this point, a thick, slimy layer that I was completely unable to clear from my skin.\nFinally, she came. I felt it in a sudden, violent shudder of her body, and heard it in her muffled, choking gasp. Waiting for the whole ordeal to end, I rode out the desperate seizing of her body while stuck to the wall of her stomach.\nShe finally calmed down, and I heard her relieved, exhausted breathing. Then, without warning, her entire body shifted, and I fell forward. I wound up upside-down, struggling to right myself as the walls of her stomach pulsed and seized around me. \nAs I fought to regain my bearings, I heard the muffled sound of her voice, but the details of consonants and vowels were impossible to hear from here. She was definitely speaking, and I could only imagine that it was to her Internet audience.\nThen she moved yet again. The rapid motion dunked me headfirst into the fleshy funnel that led to her intestines, and I had to kick and squirm to free myself. The moment I managed to climb to my feet, though, her entire stomach seized up. The fleshy walls squeezed hard, shoving me headfirst back into her throat. \nAnother violent contraction followed, and I was propelled through the tight, fleshy tunnel of her throat, out her mouth, and into the bright, cold air of the outside world. It was so terrifyingly fast; the massive motion, the relentless pressure of her muscles, the flood of light; adrenaline surged in my veins, and I was on my feet almost the moment I hit the ground, ready to run.\nThat fight-or-flight energy whithered away instantly when I saw Kristi staring down at me. Her face flushed with pleasure, her forehead beaded with sweat, she leaned over me, breathing heavy. There was a smile on her face, and I didn't like the look of it at all. I realized, belatedly, that I was in her sink, and there was nowhere I could have escaped to even if I tried. I stood in a thin pool of vomit, coated head to toe in stomach acid, surrounded on all sides by steep, white, porcelain walls. \n\"Hey there, little guy,\" Kristi said, her face splitting into a smile. \"Oh, look at you, you're so tiny!\" she exclaimed. She made a gesture with her thumb and forefinger to show me exactly how tiny I was, and I responded by flicking her off. She frowned. \"Now, that's not nice.\"\nHer left hand came out of nowhere and bowled me over. My head hit the porcelain of the sink with a solid thunk, and, dazed from the impact, I didn't realize what she was doing to me until I was hanging upside-down in midair. She held me by the ankle, staring at me with the same expression of a bored student watching fruit flies breeding. My eyes met hers, but there was no indication in her face that she even saw my eye contact.\nFinally, she spoke. \"So you're my little toy. I don't really care if you want to be or not, just stay pretty for the stream.\"\nWith a sudden flick of the wrist, she tossed me into the air. I flew what felt like miles, then, in a moment of weightlessness, I started to fall. It all happened faster than it could be explained, and I struck the palm of her hand with an impact that drove the wind from my lungs. In that moment, her fist closed around me, enveloping me in darkness.\n\"I can do whatever I want with you,\" she said, her voice seeming to come from everywhere. \"There's no escape. Fight it, enjoy it, I don't give a shit, but they like it more when you struggle.\"\nLight came flooding in as she opened her fist. Her face was right there, filling my field of view. Her eyes were almost close enough to touch, and there was a look of cruelty in them that made my skin crawl. \"I own you,\" she said. \"You might not really know what that means yet, but you will soon.\"\n","\"Okay, everyone, looks like our little guy has figured out that he's the star of his own show,\" Kristi said, her voice bubbly and her face cheerful. She looked at looked at me as if she expected me to respond favorably, even though she held me upside-down from my ankles. When my miserable expression didn't change, she looked back at the camera. \"This happens with all the little ones eventually, but I think we should celebrate.\" She looked back at me, her expression as happy as if I had just wheeled out her birthday cake. \"We're gonna have a fun little game today.\"\nFuck me running. Would I even get any mileage out of begging for my life? With my time spent inside Kristi's intestines, I had come to the realization that nobody who voluntarily spent money on this disgusting, pornographic display of human slavery would bother reporting it to the authorities, so I was trapped here until I managed my own escape. But, until I figured my way out, I had to suffer the experience, and it sounded like it was just about to get worse.Kristi held me upside-down, both of our faces pointed at the camera. I let my arms hang loose and only occasionaly looked down at her insanely attractive naked body. She had surprisingly large breasts, given her slight figure, to the point that I would not have been able to see the rest of her torso if she had raised me any higher. But, as it was, I was able to see her flat stomach, the barest shadow of abs showing through the fat, and the clean-shaven mound between her legs that led to paradise.No, not paradise. I had experienced it firsthand and I knew that it was torture when you weren't just trying to shove your dick into it. But, even so, I couldn't stop but find that dark, wrinkled gap attractive from where I was. I was sure I would regret my biological instincts in a moment.\"In honor of my little buddy learning his role, we're gonna give him a challenge,\" Kristi said. She twisted me around to look directly at my face, but her airy expression didn't fade as she continued, \"He's got five minutes to make me come. If he does, the popular vote decides what I do with him. If he doesn't, the top donor decides.\"I glanced down between her spread legs, then back up at her. Her grin seemed to grow, and her off-hand drifted down between her legs, rubbing casually at her clit. \"I'll give you a head-start, little guy,\" she said, sexual excitement practically bleeding from her face. \"You ready?\"Does it matter, cunt? I asked myself. But, clearly, it didn't matter, because her hand opened, and I fell to the ground, just a few inches away from her groin. I hit the bed so hard that I saw stars, but I still heard her say, \"Ready... go.\"It took a while to recover, which was frustrating because she had already proved that I was immortal; this little fall should have been nothing. By the time I had my feet under me again, I heard her booming voice say, \"Time's running out, little man.\"Fuck you.But, all the same, I drew up close to the giantess' crotch, which was presented before me like a painting at a museum. A hot, stinky painting in a room whose walls could slam shut around my body at any moment. Not happy about it, but sure that the 'top donor' would be the greater sadist than the masses, I started aggressively massaging Kristi's clit. I dug my hands underneath the wrinkled flesh of her vulva and wrapped my fingers around the fleshy bulb of nerve endings, squeezing and tugging at it in an effort to bring the woman to orgasm.I heard a moan above me, and felt a brief sense of victory. I could do this. The 'popular vote' might not be great, but I already knew what happened when the 'top donor' chose my fate, and I had no interest in suffering another week in the giantess' intestintes. Then, without warning, the giantess' fingers slammed up against my back and pressed me mercilessly into her pussy. Fresh air was replaced with flesh and lubricant, and my entire world became a chaotic blur of pink and brown, unbearable heat permeating every inch of my skin.In seconds, she was masturbating with my body, and there was nothing I could do but wait it out. She rubbed me up and down, mercilessly forcing me into the soft flesh of her crotch, using the texture of my body to lift herself to orgasm.If five minutes was her limit, she lost, or so it felt like. I heard her throaty gasps growing more rapid, I felt her pelvic muscles squeezing up against my face, and I knew that her hips were rocking in pleasure even if I was moving to fast to feel it. Eventually, amidst the wet, noisy torture, the giantess finally came, and just let me go, allowing me to crash backwards onto the bed and watch her pelvic muscles twitch in the afterglow of her orgasm.\"Ooohhhhh, God, I'm sorry,\" she said breathlessly, \"I'm so sorry, guys, I got carried away.\"She leaned forwards, and the hot red flesh of her vagina came crashing down towards my face, until she yanked me out from underneath it at the last moment, holding my fluid-smeared body up for the camera. \"That's my fault, guys, but I think our little guy deserves a reward, don't you? What do you think we should do?\"I had just the barest view of the screen, but I saw plenty of words that were profoundly disturbing. 'Ass,' 'eat,' and 'condom,' among others. Please, lady, I begged, don't let these fucking perverts control my life.Kristi made a face. \"You guys are nasty,\" she said, and I felt my body deflate in relief. \"I've got a better idea,\" she continued, her voice husky enough to bring terror back into my soul.She leaned back, reaching for something off the bed that was outside my field of view. After a few moments, she finally produced a bizarrely complicated contraption of a sex toy. The shape of the dark blue dildo in her hand was obvious, although it looked downright alien, with weird ridges and a scaly texture. It seemed like the dick of an impossible, human-reptile hybrid. From its underside ran a clear tube, connected to a fist-sized plastic capsule.She dropped the dildo between her legs and grabbed the little capsule. She gave it a tiny squeeze, and I saw thick, white fluid flood into the tube. My eyes widened, and I offered a token struggle before I realized that the effort was useless. The giantess noticed, though, because she giggled, \"Looks like he recognizes it, doesn't he? The little pervert.\"I didn't get to see the response, but her provocation was infuriating nonetheless. You're one to talk, I thought, cum lube was made for perverts, you little bitch. Would you want to drown in it?She straightened up the dildo, making sure that I was angled so I could see the whole thing, and placed the little lube container directly underneath it. I knew what would happen; her weight would compress the lube capsule, and, every time she drove down on the dildo, another little squirt would force its way into her. She'd be dripping with the fluid in minutes, and she'd have a nice little creampie for her horny audience. And I would be caught in the middle of that hot, white mess, pressed between the flesh of her vagina and the hard rubber of the dildo, trying and failing not to let the lube into my lungs.I had no desire to be a part of it, but I had no choice. She lowered me down onto the dildo, and I realized, with a shock, that it seemed to be larger than it should have been. I had been almost six inches tall, able to reach her clit from the bed, and now a dildo that could fit comfortably in her hand seemed four, maybe even five times as tall as I was. I couldn't believe it, but there was no denying what I saw with my own eyes. She had control over my size?Before I could explore the consequences of this terrifying new reality, she shoved my feet into the narrow hole at the head of the dildo. Her fingers, now so large that her fingernails were bigger than my head, pressed down on my shoulders, and I slid painfully into the smooth rubber canal. The dark blue rubber was cold, and squeezed me on all sides with incredible force. Kristi's pelvic muscles were nothing compared to this, even at the height of orgasm. The rubber wrapped tight around my entire body, and I simply couldn't move, no matter how hard I tried. I could barely even breathe. It may have been soft and pliant to her, but, at my size, it was as hard as stone. The tube was meant for a thin stream of fluid, and she had shoved me into it. How the hell was I supposed to get out?I should have known what would have come next, but it still came as a surprise. Impossibly, the pressure increased massively, and I felt it come down from my head to my toes in a wave. It was as if the dildo was trying to swallow me, and I felt myself pushed down an inch against the smooth rubber. But I knew that the giantess had just finally slid her body down on top of the dildo.The force of her vagina wrapping around the dildo passed my feet, and then I felt warm fluid suddenly start to well up from underneath me. The sensation was like sinking into quicksand, but it only took seconds. The panic that rose in my throat could not be denied, but I could barely move a muscle against the pressure that surrounded me. Warm, sticky fluid shot up from underneath me and covered my entire body, rising up to my neck in an instant.But it stopped there. I felt the pressure lessen, the relief rising from my toes all the way to my head, and the fluid drew back a bit, falling down to my chest. My brain gave a sigh of relief, but I knew exactly what was happening. She sat up, and, in a moment, she'd come back down, and shit was going to get a lot worse.She drove the dildo back into her, and, not only did the pressure from the walls that surrounded me grow to a bone-crushing level, the warm, sticky, opaque white lube shot up past my head with such force that I was pushed almost a foot upwards along the tiny tube in the dildo.I drew a lungful of the lube at that moment, gallons of the sticky, salty fluid sliding down my throat. I coughed instinctively, but there was no fresh air to be had, just more lube. The stuff was more or less flavorless, but was thick and sticky, coating the inside of my mouth and throat like a layer of paint. I wasn't sure if I'd ever be able to cough it all out when I finally got a breath of fresh air. It got everywhere immediately; I couldn't even see the blue rubber that was pressed against my face through the opaque white fluid.Slowly, she pulled the dildo out and pushed it back in again, and, this time, surrounded by lube, the sudden surge of pressure from beneath my feet pushed me an entire body length upwards. I realized then what was happening. The tube was so tight and my body was so large, relatively speaking, that I was essentially a human fluid seal. A shitty one that left plenty of leakage, but she still wasn't going to get the creampie her perverted fans wanted until I was shot out of the dildo, directly into her waiting pussy.She seemed to realize it, too, because she starting bouncing violently up and down on the dildo, but seemed to be sparing her weight on the lube capsule, because very little of it came from below me, and I only moved a few inches at a time from the waves of pressure that descended down on me every time she penetrated herself.I could just barely hear her moaning, and her pace quickened, pausing only briefly to reposition herself. Even after my short time with her, I knew the rhythm of this. Her moaning increased in volume and pitch, turning into choking, squeaky gasps for air, then, finally, she slammed all her weight down on the dildo and the capsule underneath it. I was launched from the tip of the dildo like a bullet from a gun, a massive gush of sticky fluid following behind me. In the rush of fluid, the sudden heat of her body, and the hard impact I had with the walls of her vagina, I didn't quite hear the noise that she made when she came. Through the thick white of the lube, I could just barely see that I was nestled in a little pocket between the head of the dildo and the hard pink mound of her cervix, suspended in a bubble of fluid that couldn't go anywhere because of the dildo filling her vagina.Then, slowly, she drew the dildo out, and the fluids followed, oozing down the muscular walls as they drew back together in the absence of the massive bulk of the fake reptilian cock. Between the workout from the dildo, her position, and my new, smaller size, I wasn't large enough to be trapped between the walls, and I was carried along with the fluids until they thinned out enough that I finally stuck to the wall.She giggled, and her vagina squeezed shut as she did so, forcing more fluid out of her pussy and driving me further out, until I could just barely see the light of the outside world. She straightened up, and gravity did the rest. I saw the head of the dildo directly underneath her, glazed in thick white lube like sugar on a cinnamon bun, and then I fell directly on top of it. If I had been stronger, I would have been able to climb back into the hole. I almost wanted to try, just to spare myself whatever her next move was.The lube had thinned out enough that I could vaguely see what she was doing, far above me. Her pale, thin figure, flushed from pleasure and exertion, was straddling the dildo, her right hand slowly working in circles over her pussy. Strands of cum lube stretched out between her fingers and smeared all over her groin. Kristi looked down at me, then smiled and walked herself backwards. Still on her knees, she leaned forwards, deliberately arching her back to keep her ass in the air, until her face was right over me. Then she opened her mouth and brought it down on the head of the dildo.The outside world was quickly darkened, and the noise of her gentle moans was deafening in here. Her breath was hot, and her tongue, as it slimed over the head of the dildo and picked me up along with plenty of lube, was even hotter. She ran me around the inside of her mouth, tasting my lube-soaked body like a piece of living candy.I thought, for a moment, that I was crazy, but it quickly became clear that, as she tossed me around the inside of her mouth, that I was growing even smaller. Soon, my entire body was smaller than one of her teeth, and she demonstrated that by depositing me on one of her molars, pressing down playfully with her jaw before pulling me out and tucking me under her tongue.Then she sucked everything out, an experience that was terrifying and excruciating. The pressure dropped to nothing, and my lungs were completely emptied, air, lube, spit, nothing, leaving me gaping like a fish out of water. She sucked my skin dry, leaving nothing but a thin layer of saliva that seeped from the walls around me.Then she tilted her head back, and, in a deafening, fleshy noise, swallowed everything. Everything but me, tucked safely away under her tongue.I gasped for air as the pressure returned, but there was little to be had under her tongue. Just heat and spit. I saw light and heard, as if it was the voice of God himself, her satisfied, \"Ahhh....\" Then, her voice so loud that it felt like it was drilling directly into my ears, shaking my very bones, she said, \"That was tasty. See you guys later.\"\n","Kristi spat me out onto the bed only a few seconds after delivering that last line, presumably having closed her livestream. Greedily gulping down the first taste of fresh air I had in what felt like hours, wiping slimy bodily fluids from my eyes and trying to adjust to the sudden brightness of the outside world, I didn't notice the giantess' face hovering just over me at first. But, when I did, the surprised, terrified response I exhibited was apparently amusing to her.She did have a nice smile, though. It was only a moment later that I realized that it was absolutely outrageous that I should notice her smile at all. But, before I could continue that train of thought, she spoke, and the earth-shaking volume of her voice stunned me into submission. My vision narrowed, and all I could focus on were the words coming out of her mouth.\"So,\" she said, her tone playful. \"I have to give you back to Renee tomorrow. We'll play together on the stream for a bit, but this is the last day we get to be together... Alone.\"She tossed her hair back, and, when some strands fell back into her eye, she brushed them aside thoughtlessly. She didn't seem to realize that, at her size and at this distance, she was speaking with the voice of God. Instead, she was talking like they were engaged in just regular, playful pillow talk. \"God, you're just so cute!\" she exclaimed, her smile broadening, reaching forwards with her thumb and forefinger pinched together. Her hand drew close enough that those two fingers completely obscured my vision before she pulled back. Her smile faded a bit as she shifted to cradle her head in her hands. \"So, do you want to have a little bit of fun?\" she asked, tilting her head a bit.Was she looking for a response? In any other circumstance, the answer would have been a wholehearted 'yes,' but how the fuck was I supposed to answer that question when there was no response that didn't end up with me used as a living dildo? I hesitated, not sure exactly what was the right answer, but Kristi didn't seem to care. \"I'll be better then Renee, I promise,\" she said breathily. Her gaze scanned up and down my tiny body, and her expression grew a little too lusty for comfort.She chewed on her lower lip for a moment, then straightened up. She waved her hand over me, quick, but, at the same time, precise. There was a deliberation to her gesture that I didn't catch on to at first. Then, without warning, she started to shrink. Or, rather, I started to grow. It was hard to tell the difference at first, but, after a few seconds, the reality was clear; Kristi had control over my size.I wasn't sure if this was a good or a bad thing. Quickly, my surroundings shrank around me, and it occurred to me that I no longer had any clue as to what size was normal. As I grew, and Kristi's body seemed to shrink, I had no idea how to process my surroundings. Fear paralyzed me, and, in a few short seconds, I found myself on my back on the bed, staring up at Kristi's bare-naked body.It took a moment, but I realized quickly that I had been grown to full size, or near enough to make no difference. Kristi straddled me in an uncomfortably erotic way, the warmth of her crotch pressed up against my own. I tried to suppress my erection, but instinct would not be denied. The blood rushed down and I felt myself slowly growing hard. Whatever we had done before didn't seem to matter anymore; she was right there, basically asking me to fuck her. Kristi, still staring at me, grinned. \"You like, that, don't you?\" she asked.She leaned forwards and ground her hips up and down, the soft wetness between her legs sliding over my slowly-hardening cock. Against my will, I stiffened at the sensation, and the primal voice in my head that told me to fuck her raw grew to a deafening volume. I considered tossing her off me and trying to escape, but, from where I lay, it didn't seem even remotely possible. It was illogical, I knew, but the two of us, naked, together, in this position? There was only one way this could end.It wasn't lost on me that, barely minutes before, I had been inside that woman's mouth, ready to be swallowed like a piece of food. It did not escape me that, if she could grow me to this size, she could likely shrink me back down to morsel-size at a whim. But those realities seemed insignificant next to the eroticism of the woman straddling me. My hands drifted up and grabbed her ass, guiding her down to my now fully-erect dick.Her smile grew, and she let me take control. When I felt her pussy slide over my cock, I let out a tiny moan, and she breathed a curse at the same time. I slid her down, slowly, all the way to my hips, reveling in the pleasure on her face. Then, when I was as deep as I could get, I shifted my grip, just a bit, to get the best leverage, and started to drill her as hard as I could muster.Her expression of shock lasted only a moment, and, it shifted into something that told me that she loved what I was doing. She looked down between her legs, seeming to marvel at the dick that penetrated her over and over and over again. She shifted her hips a little bit and eagerly played along, rocking her body back and forth against my rhythmic thrusting. Her whole body writhed against mine, hands clutching my shoulders hard, fingernails digging in. Her head fell backwards, her mouth agape, silently screaming her pleasure as the heat between us intensified with every thrust.After barely two minutes, maybe three, to be generous, I came hard. My whole body tightened and stars danced in my vision as my very soul seemed to shoot out through my dick. I could barely draw breath to let out the scream that I wanted to, but I could see Kristi's face, bound in pleasure, eagerly driving her hips up and down, and sucking up every last drop of cum that shot out of me. That expression on her face, the very idea that I had made her cum, seemed like the hottest thing in the world to me in that brief moment.Then it all came crashing down. A ragged, involuntary moan of ecstasy escaped my lips as clarity and regret washed over me. What the fuck was I thinking? Kristi had handed me a chance to escape, and I had wasted it having sex with her. I had already been buried from head to toe in the woman's vagina; shit, I had spent days as a living, breathing tampon for another woman. Why the hell did I toss away my chance at regaining my normal life just to make my dick happy?Maybe there was still a chance. Maybe I just had to take a swing at her and hope that I could knock her out and get out of here. But, by the time I had that thought, I was already shrinking. Kristi still straddled me, her face flushed and her body sweaty, but I wouldn't have been able to reach past her breasts anymore. Seeing the lock of shock on my face, Kristi giggled, biting her lower lip like she expected even more sex.My perspective continued to fall as my body continued to shrink, and Kristi watched it happen with delight written across her face. In seconds, I went from full height, to half her height, to staring up at her crotch hanging far above me, a foamy mix of cum and lubricant hanging under the fragile force of surface tension from the narrow slit that led deep into her body. From sexual ectasy and then to regret, I immediately grew angry. I had filled that woman the way a man should, and this was how she treated me?But anger dissipated quickly as well, giving way to fear, as I realized what was coming next. The giantess scooped me up off the bed and lifted me up between her legs, holding me faceup in her hand. That I could fit bodily in her palm was humiliating enough, but then I saw her crotch twitching, her pelvic muscles squeezing, and a thin stream of creamy white bodily fluids came pouring downwards, directly onto my face. That was my own cum. No man would even voluntarily taste it, but I was being drowned in it. I heard the giantess giggle, and even more came gushing out as her pussy twitched with every breath. I coughed and sputtered, trying not to vomit as I thrashed around, looking for an escape, a single breath of fresh air. But it was impossible to get; I was too small. Every breath drew warm, salty, viscuous fluid down my throat, which set me into a coughing fit, which just drew more bodily fluids into my lungs. Very quickly, my lungs were filled with hot fluid, a thick, salty taste filling my mouth and throat. It seemed inescapable, but, even so, I heaved and squirmed, disgusted at the fact that I was breathing my own cum. I was only vaguely aware of the giantess lifting me further up, but it was impossible to ignore the immediate heat and pressure of her shoving me headfirst into her vagina.The sudden transition from the outside world to the inside of the woman's body was so shocking that, for a moment, it overrode my disgust at being trapped in an ocean of my own semen. But then, with her heartbeat pounding deafeningly at me from all sides, I realized that this was the pit into which I had blown my load, and the thin dribble that had drowned me already was just the smallest sample.I let out a desperate, frothy shout, muted by the relentless pressure of Kristi's vaginal walls surrounding my body. I could feel burning-hot bodily fluids filling my lungs with every breath. My entire world was a cloudy mix of white cum, diluted by vaginal lubricant, and bright pink flesh. I had been taller than Kristi just a minute ago, and now I was so small that my own load seemed like an ocean. I wasn't sure if I was dreaming it, but I was pretty sure I could feel the tickle of individual sperm squirming against my skin.Amidst my disgust and claustrophobic panic, I came to one, definitive conclusion. I would never let myself get used like that again. If the barest chance to escape ever emerged again, come hell or high water, I would do everything I could to blow it wide open.\n","I had no idea how much time passed trapped in Kristi's pussy. It could have been hours, or even days. Her heartbeat was a persistent, almost soothing rhythm, but, even if I tried, it was no way to count time. I didn't need to eat, or drink, or even sleep; the oppressive heat and pressure of the giantess' vagina was my only reality. After enough time, that world of flesh and fluid seemed almost normal to me. She said that she 'had to give me back to Renee tomorrow,' but, from my perspective, it could very well have been weeks. When she pulled me out of her body, the sudden shock of light and cold air was too painful to ignore.I had a brief view of the camera, of Kristi and Renee standing next to each other, both naked as the day they were born, before my stomach dropped and I was falling to the floor.I hit the ground hard, the impact driving the air from my lungs. Gasping for air, I stared up at the giantess' intimidating figures. The massive pillars of their thighs drew up towards eternity, leading to naked hips and the women's impossibly slender bodies. Standing beside Renee's, with her dark brown skin and jet black hair, Kristi's fair complexion seemed almost ghostly by comparison.  With a brief pause, they both eyed the camera, making sure that it was running, then leaned down to start their theater.\"Oh my God!\" Renee exclaimed, \"What is this?\"\"Is that a little man?\" Kristi asked.\"I think it is,\" answered Renee.\"Is he trying to spy on us?\"\"What a little creep!\" Renee exclaimed. She made no effort to cover herself.Kristi crouched down, her hips driving downwards with terrifying speed, and the thick, fishy smell that emanated from her bare crotch followed shortly after with a wave of warm air. \"Did you think we'd find you, little guy?\" She reached forwards, knocking me back onto my ass with her forefinger. \"Huh? Did you? Did you think we'd find out?\"\"He probably thought he was so smart,\" said Renee.\"Well, what are you gonna do now, little guy? Huh?\" Renee's foot came out of nowhere, driving me mercilessly into the hardwood floor. Through the massive weight of the giantess' body, I could still hear Kristi's muffled words. \"You can't run, you can't hide, so now what?\"Renee lifted her foot, and, as I gasped for air, I saw the two giantess' staring down at me with pure malice. Kristi had lifted herself from her crouch and was now standing over me with her hands on her hips. Was that look part of their script, or was it genuine? \"Ooh, he's tougher than he looks,\" Kristi giggled.\"Do you like that, little man?\"\"I bet he does, little perv.\"\"Yeah,\" Renee agreed. She brought her foot over me, holding it for a moment over my head so I could see the pale, wrinkled skin of her sole, tiny debris clinging to the soft flesh. Then she drove her heel down, shoving me back down into the ground. Over the blood pounding in my head from the tremendous pressure, I could hear her yelling at me. \"Do you like that, little guy? Do you like my hot, sweaty feet?\"When she lifted her foot, I clung to the bottom for a moment before falling back to the ground.I scrambled to my feet, knowing that there was no point in running but looking for a way to escape anyway. The knowledge that I was more or less invincible, the fact that I had already survived her stepping on me twice, did little to quell the animal fear of being underfoot between such titanic figures. My instinctive panic probably made good footage for the audience. \"What do you think we should do with him?\" Kristi asked.\"Maybe he can just live in my shoe,\" Renee suggested. \"My little foot slave. How does that sound, little guy?\"She brought her foot back again, this time planting her heel and bringing her foot just far enough down that she could tap my head with her big toe. Harmless though it may have been, it was still forceful enough to knock me back onto my ass.\"Mmm, no, I think he'd actually like that,\" Kristi said. \"Maybe just eat him.\"\"But I want to keep him,\" Renee pouted.If I had been in an position, at any size other than where I was right then, the hammy porn-acting dialogue between the two women would have been almost comical.\"Where can you keep him?\"\"Oooh,\" Renee purred, \"How about in my vagina?\" she giggled and dropped to her knees. The impact shook my entire world as her weight slammed into the ground on either side of me. She lowered her right hand between her legs and spread her pussy open, revealing the bright pink flesh hidden beneath the dark brown lips. \"That's what you wanted to see, isn't it? You want to get up close and personal with it?\"Kristi leaned forward, a grin on her face. I couldn't help but notice the way her breasts sagged when she did so. \"Ooh, I like the sound of that. Do you think you could make her come, little man?\"Definitely not how normal people talked, but normal people didn't stand around completely naked talking to shrunken people either.Renee made a show of how horny the thought was getting her. \"Mmmm, yeah,\" she said, biting her lip. With her right hand, she started to run slow circles over her clit. \"I bet you'd feel good squirming around in my tight, wet pussy, wouldn't you?\"\"It's too good for him,\" remarked Kristi.\"I don't care,\" Renee moaned. \"I want him now.\" She leaned forward, reaching out with the hand that was not currently occupied. It shot forward at such a tremendous, terrifying speed that I instinctively jumped back, but it didn't do anything but make Kristi giggle. \"I think he's trying to run away!\" she exclaimed.I was smaller than her fingertips, and Renee grabbed me between her thumb and middle finger, pulling me towards her in a dizzying blur of motion. She held me up to her face, staring at me with eyes that seemed as big as swimming pools, speaking in a voice that I could feel in my bones. \"Oh, you don't want to be in my vagina?\" she asked. The way her lips and tongue moved as she spoke, those massive muscles flexing and moving, the knowledge that she could just toss me into her mouth and I would be utterly at her mercy, was absolutely terrifying. \"You wanted to see it so bad before. This is just the up-close view.\"With that ridiculous line, she brought her hand, and me in it, down between her legs, giving me a tour of her upper body that was so quick that all I could process was dark brown flesh. Then she held me to linger just inches away from her vagina. Her other hand rubbed patiently at her clitoris, tugging on the soft flesh and showing brief peeks of the bright pink that hid beneath the dark brown.\"Did you think you would get caught, little guy?\" Kristi asked from out of view. Renee had no response to offer, and they certainly weren't looking for one from me. With a moan, she slid me between the lips of her labia, and my entire world was replaced with soft, pink heat. With a squelching, wet sound of flesh and fluid and more flesh, she guided me, pinned under her middle finger, towards her vagina and pushed me as deep in as she could.Her finger retreated, and I was left alone in the sweltering confines of her vagina. At this microscopic size, it was less crushing than it would have been, but the claustrophobia of hot, wet flesh pressing in on me from all sides was just as bad. Maybe even worse, with the knowledge that I had what felt like hundreds of feet of the same sexual prison chamber between me and the fresh air of the outside world.I could hear her talking, occasionally laughing, but it was too muffled to make out what she was saying. The flexing of her diaphragm was accompanied by gentle, and occasionally not-so-gentle twitches in her pelvic muscles, which squeezed my tiny body tightly with the fleshy walls that seemed to stretch forever around me. Those brief contractions were merely a hint at the full, brutal force that her body was capable of.But I knew how this ended. After a few lines of cheesy dialogue and a couple of shifts in gravity, indicating the giantess was moving about, I could feel her start to masturbate. Even this deep inside her, the ferocity with which she attacked her clitoris was clearly evident in the tug and pull of the pliant flesh that surrounded me. Her heartbeat, pulsing at me from all sides through the hot flesh of her vagina, rose quickly in pace, and, in short order, her pelvic muscles squeezed hard with the first contraction on her rise to orgasm.Soon, I could feel her hips rocking. I could hear her moans through the flesh that surrounded me. Her pelvic muscles squeezed over and over again, harder and harder every time, and her heartbeat grew to a feverish staccato. I was little more than a mote of dust, completely helpless amidst her body's natural responses, so every twitch of her muscles seemed like a titanic force to me. When her vaginal muscles squeezed, the chaos of the flexing elastic walls and the fluid-filled gaps between them tossed me in unpredictable directions. After only a few minutes, I had no idea where I was or what was happening; I could only guess from the pitch of the giantess' muffled voice how close it was to being over.Despite what I thought was increasing familiarity with the rhythm of the giantess' sexual labors, Renee's climax came as a surprise. There was little that I could have done to prepare for it, but I was regardless caught completely unprepared. The walls around me squeezed with ferocious intensity that was painful even at my miniscule size, then held there for three, four, five seconds. My heartbeat pounded in my ears as hers pounded from all around me, and her squirming hips carried me for a wild roller-coaster of a ride.Then she finally came down, a rhythm that I was much more familiar with because both Renee and Kristi experienced it much the same way. I could even visualize what it looked like from the outside, although I knew that that was not something to be proud of. Still squirming, still gasping, her pelvic muscles squeezed around me again and again, but with rapidly decreasing strength and more and more time between each contraction. Finally, she let out a deep, shuddering breath, one that I could feel in the twitching of the walls surrounding me, and it was all over.A moment of calm. This wasn't a great place for any person to be no matter the circumstance, especially in the fluid-soaked, blazing hot aftermath of her orgasm, but it was somehow a relief to finally be finished with her sexual torture. At least for now. They were recording a video, so who knew what would happen next.I heard Renee talking, a question, probably, but I couldn't make out what she was asking. I couldn't hear anything of whatever Kristi's answer was, if there was one at all, but Renee spoke again after a few seconds, then gravity suddenly shifted again. At this point, I couldn't even tell which way was up anymore.Her finger came barreling towards me out of nowhere, from the direction that I thought would have been deeper into her vagina. Fuck, I had really gotten turned around. Her fingertip plunged past me, squeezing me harder into the soft walls, and then began to probe around with surprising dexterity. The elastic flesh of her vagina, which could have held me fast forever, no matter how hard I fought, parted willingly before her giant finger. There was no escape. Her fingertip pressed me forcefully against the wall of her vagina, then, in one smooth motion, drug me painfully across what felt like miles of flesh and out into the open.Through the blurring layer of fluid that held me to her fingertip, I could see Kristi holding the camera barely feet away from me, looking up from underneath at the giantess' crotch, and me held on her fingertip right beside it. \"Mmm, there you are,\" Renee moaned. \"Look, he's all wet now,\" said Kristi.\"Do you like that, little guy?\" Renee asked. \"Do you like the taste of my pussy?\"\"Maybe you should keep him locked up in there like a prisoner,\" Kristi offered.\"Oooh, I like the sound of that,\" Renee agreed. \"But what about...\" Renee turned around, holding me in more or less in place so that the camera, and I, could get an up-close view of her ass. Kristi laughed out loud; I couldn't see her, I could barely see anything but Renee's ass, but she was definitely close. That laugh of hers was deafening. \"Yeah, how about that, little man?\" She reached forward from behind me and grabbed Renee's butt, pulling apart one of the cheeks, offering me a brief view of the giantess' dark, puckered anus before letting go. Renee was totally into it, or at least pretending like she was. She leaned forwards, rocking her hips left to right slightly, showcasing both her ass and her pussy to the camera. She ran her free hand up her thigh slowly and slapped her ass. Though I was far beyond the point where I could consider anything about these women erotic, it was somewhat entertaining to watch it jiggle like that. \"Do you want to live in my ass, little guy?\" Renee asked, straightening up and looking back over her shoulder.\"I bet he does,\" Kristi responded, \"Who wouldn't want to live in that juicy booty?\"\"Do you like staring at it, you little perv?\" asked Renee. \"Well, here, let's get you up close and personal.\"She leaned forwards again and, with her free hand, and even with the other fingers of the hand that held me, she pulled her ass far apart, showing everything hidden beneath. Her tight asshole, surprisingly clean, and her fluid-soaked pussy that I had been trapped in not minutes before. She brought me closer, and closer, and closer, heat and stench overwhelming me as I was lifted to face an asshole that was larger than my entire body. God, please, don't put me in there.Renee giggled, and her asshole twitched. The smell was horrific, shit and sweat and everything else that came from below her waist all mixing into a nauseating, sour soup of body odor. \"Have fun!\" she exclaimed. Then smeared me onto the soft, wrinkled flesh just above her asshole.Rolled between her finger and the flesh, I was left facing outwards, stuck to the sweaty, stinky skin as her finger pulled away. I had a glimpse of the camera, and Kristi behind it, before Renee let go, and her ass came crashing in around me.Even at my size, the pressure was crushing, worse than anything I had experienced inside the giantess' vagina. Those massive muscles at the tops of her legs were not abstractions that lent the curves to a shapely ass, they were a real, living force that pressed me into her body with a will. As she swung her hips from side to side, I not only had to endure the chaotic, unpredictable ride, but also the flexing of the muscles on either side of me, pressing me relentlessly into the other one.\"Mmmm, I can feel him squirming in there,\" Renee moaned. I could hear her as clear as day, despite the seemingly infinite flesh that surrounded me.\"Do you think he can feel you moving around from there?\" asked Kristi.\"I hope he can,\" Renee said. \"If I squeeze...\" Both of the walls that surrounded me turned immediately to steel and pressed hard on my tiny body. \"Oooh, I bet he felt that.\"\"He's probably so squished in there,\" Kristi remarked.\"It's probably so tight. This is what you get, little man,\" Renee yelled at him. \"I hope you enjoy your new home!\"\n","It wasn't long before the giantess finally fished me out, but even those few moments were excruciating. The stench and the heat were overwhelming, and Renee's normal gait was absolutely brutal. Her hips shifted with every step, rocking me back and forth like some kind of perverted carnival ride. Every time her foot hit the gorund, I felt it in a deep, distant thud, and the muscle on one side of me quickly tightened, pushing me mercilessly against the soft flesh against the other side, before it abruptly let up. And then the process started all over again.I felt like a ping-pong ball, tossed back and forth between the unyielding muscles of Renee's ass. The whole time, I was subjected to the stifling heat and suffocating stench of her most intimate parts. It wasn't erotic, it wasn't enjoyable, it wasn't even tolerable, and it wasn't long before I wanted nothing more than to die.Fortunately, the massive woman finally pulled me out. She leaned forwards far enough that I finally saw daylight between her buttcheeks, a pale incandescent light that could be anywhere; a bathroom, a bedroom, a porn studio, who knew? Her hand, terrifying in its size, came forwards and sought me out with frightening dexterity. She pinched me painfully between her thumb and forefinger, and lifted me with dizzying speed out into the open world. Fresh air, finally. My god... Her fingers shrank slightly around me as she sized me up, but the growth stopped too soon; I was still barely an inch tall. A disorienting blur of motion, and I found myself face-to-face with the ginatess. In that moment, faced with her massive face; eyes that were larger than I was, a mouth that could swallow me whole without a second thought; terror seized my entire body. I froze, staring at her with eyes wide; I had all but forgotten my brief ordeal in her ass; all I wanted was not to die.Renee studied me for a moment, then spoke. The deafening volume of her voice, with the terrifying motion of her facial muscles, kept me from processing what the hell she was saying for the first few seconds. It was just noise. Noise and the threatening motion of a predator's maw.\"...next is something for me,\" the giantess said. I had no idea what she had said befoire, but her expression didn't give my any reason for optimism. Her eyes, previously locked to his, turned sideways, and she shrugged her naked shoulders. \"Maybe I'll stream it, who knows? It could play well, but you're not gonna like it either way.\"What the hell did that mean? Renee lowered her hand in another dizzying blur of motion, leaving me dazed and confused until my perspective finally settled on a tiny mold of clear plastic. Disoriented by the sudden, chaotic shift, it took a moment for me to recognize the pointed mushroom shape. The moment it clicked, Renee turned it over and dropped me into a narrow opening at the bottom.Holy shit. It was a buttplug. A hollow one, with space for a shrunken prisoner. I knew immediately what would come next, and I pounded against the walls of the plastic prison in vain. Please, please no, I begged. Renee didn't care at all. She grabbed the base off the floor and screwed it back into place, sealing me into the stale air inside the toy. At my size, my protests, my desperate struggles were completely impotent; the giantess could do whatever the hell she wanted with me, and the plastic prison that I was trapped in. She flipped it over, and I tumbled helplessly around like a die in a cup, slamming painfully against the walls.Renee produced a thin bottle of lube and cracked it open, oozing a clear fluid over the plastic, then smearing it across the surface with her fingers. Every tiny motion of the buttplug tossed me back and forth, making it impossible for me to keep my footing. Finally, satisfied with the lubrication, Renee crouched down and brought her toy, and me along with it, under her crotch. Through the thin haze of the lube, I could see the full intimate expanse of flesh between the giantess' legs, the sliver of pink between brown labia, and the dark, puckered hole that I had just been suffering next to. In a brief moment of bizarre lucidity, I realized that that woman had been sitting on my face not a few days ago, and I loved it. She pushed the plug up against her asshole, and I watched from inside as it parted slowly, her body enveloping my prison inch by inch. The dark, fleshy tunnel beyond filling more and more of my vision until, in a sudden jerk, the rest of the plug slid in, sealing me into her ass.I could hear her heartbeat, steadily thumping at me from all sides, I could feel her movement, the gentle swinging of her hips, and the thumping of her feet hitting the ground was a deep, bassy sound accompanied with a subtle shake of my tiny prison.I didn't bother trying to gain my footing with all that unpredictable motion. The inside of the butt plug was rapidly heating up with her body pressing in on all sides, but it seemed to be sealed from the foul air inside her asshole. That was the one silver lining: I could see where I was and I could feel the heat, but I couldn't smell it.No bodily fluids, no crushing pressure, no suffocating stench. Compared to what else she could have done to me, it was relatively pleasant. Maybe this would be a new normal, and I could spend most of my time free of her torture.*****\"So he can't hear us, but he's up there,\" Renee said, lowering her phone down to her ass. She wiggled her hips a bit, then brought the phone back up to her face. \"I'm sure he's loving it. Who wouldn't want to be in this tight butt?\"She giggled, but kept the phone camera on her face as she walked. \"He gets to come with me while I work out. How's that for motivation?\" She bit her lip and looked around conspiratorily. \"Do you wanna see him? I could...\" She suddenly noticed someone watching, and her tone shifted. \"No, nope. It'll wait.\" A grin started to creep across her face. \"You'll see him eventually.\"Renee walked with a confident swagger into the gym. Leg day, a favorite for the \"family-friendly\" platforms. She could edit out any naughty bits; and there would be naughty bits; and save them for the people who paid her to see them, but there were hundreds of thousands more people who liked to see her ass doing squats in compression shorts on Instagram. And plenty of them would get excited to hear that she had a tiny guest along for the ride.If not, well, there was a filter for those tags.She was at the gym super early in the morning, when there would be almost nobody else in. She didn't intend to get naked on the gym floor, but she could use the equipment and set up the camera without anybody interfering. She did her workouts, squats and deadlifts, taking time between sets to move the camera around to get footage from different angles. From the front, the side, the back, even underneath. She was fairly confident that the shot from underneath would show the buttplug sticking out from her skintight shorts, which might not survive long if she put it on Instagram.A brief run, with only a little footage since nobody wanted to watch a woman run for twenty minutes, no matter how good the ass shot was, and then she hit the showers. This was why she got here so early; nobody would be in there so she could play the giantess angle a bit without weirding out any strangers.She stripped her top, put the phone down on the bench, and hit 'record.'\"Do you think he liked that? I bet he loved it, that little perv,\" she said, turning to the side and flexing her butt. She ran a hand down her leg and slapped her ass, \"Did you feel that, little guy? How you holding up back there?\"Renee leaned forwards into the camera, as if sharing a secret with it. \"You know, he asked me to put him there. He wants to stay there all day.\" She bit her lip and looked away, making a show of thinking naughty thoughts. \"Do you want to see?\"She turned around and bent over, knees together, showing her ass to the camera, and slowly slid her shorts down, rocking her hips as she did so. She stopped just when her pussy was exposed, and reached up and tapped the bottom of the buttplugg with her finger. \"That's him in there. My cute little butt prisoner.\"She knew that they couldn't see him; the cap on the buttplug, the hole that she had deposited her shrunken prisoner into, was a heart-shaped pink plastic gem. She didn't even need the shrunken man for this bit, frankly, but it turned her on knowing that there was one there, and the knowledge that the opaque cap literally kept him in the dark about what she was doing made it that much better. Maybe an attentive viewer would see the moisture between her legs. \"I couldn't stop thinking about him,\" she purred. Spreading her knees just a bit, she reached her right hand between her legs and slowly slid her middle finger along her pussy, parting her labia to allow the camera to see the pink underneath. \"I can feel him moving around in there.\"She dunked her middle finger into her vagina and moaned. \"Oh, God. It's so much better than a vibrator, and it's quieter.\"She stood up abruptly and turned back to the camera, getting up close to it once again. \"Nobody here suspects a thing,\" she whispered, and giggled. \"Come on, let's go take a shower.\"*****Very quickly, the air inside the buttplug had gone from stale to sour. Whatever hostile stench existed inside her asshole had not yet entered my prison, but my constant breathing had poisoned my tiny air pocket. It was uncomfortable to breathe, but I still suffered no ill effects. No headache, no pain, and fully alert the whole time. I already knew that this weird invulnerability had kept me alive in situations where I should have been killed instantly, but it seemed more like a torturous curse than a good thing at this point. Renee was working out, that much was obvious. The repetitive motion, her deafening, rapid heartbeat, and the incredible heat were all proof of that. It was unpredictable and insufferable, but it was still better than having to smell it. I could hear her speaking from time to time, too. And to whom? Probably hamming it up for her goddamn stream. Fuck, I had to get out of this.When she ran, it was the worst. The constant pounding, slamming, and bouncing turned my tiny world into absolute chaos. I was tossed around like a roulette ball, slamming painfully against every wall of the buttplug over and over and over again, unable to tell which way was up. And it seemed to last forever. Holy shit, is this bitch running a marathon?Finally, it stopped. She was done, thank God. Her heartbeat slowly started to cool down and I realized, with a breath of relief, that she was finally finished with her workout. Now just leave me here, I thought. Forget about me and go about your day.More walking, more movement, more talking. I couldn't hear what she was saying and I couldn't see what she was doing, but she definitely had a real monologue going this time. Probably more camera work.Then there was a sudden and unexpected shift, and a new noise I had not heard before, drowning out all the others. The buzz of a vibrator, and it was deafening. It took a minute before I realized that Renee was masturbating, and had shoved a dildo all the way into her vagina, its bulk pushing up against her colon and shoving me and my tiny prison aside.You whore, I thought. I hope you never get a job with all this porn you're putting out onto the Internet. It would be a small consolation to my position of abject slavery, but it would at least be something.It didn't end, though. I expected her to cum quickly and pull the vibrator out, but it didn't happen. Time passed, and the vibrator modulated repeatedly in strength over and over again. I could hear her moaning, and I could feel her moving, but I had no other indication of what was happening. What the fuck was she up to?*****Renee let the stream go live; nobody would see the footage from before until she uploaded it herself, but she started the live stream while she was in the shower. She washed herself for a few minutes, biding her time, waiting until she had a few viewers, then decided to start the show.\"Hey, guys, guess what I've got?\" she asked over the roar of the shower water. She turned her back to the camera and spread her buttcheeks, showing the plug. \"Our little guy has a new home now. We're having lots of fun together. But....\" She turned around and produced the other toy, the one she had been hiding in her gym bag. The pink, silicone vibrator was intended to be used as a panty vibrator, with a short, thick plug that went inside her and a thin, flexible antenna that doubled as a clit tickler. \"He hasn't met his new neighbor yet.\"She pressed the button on the antenna and it started vibrating gently. She grinned and brought the vibrator close to the phone so they could hear it. \"He's gonna stay in there for a while,\" she said, \"And his neighbor is moving in for the long haul as well.\" She closed her eyes and moaned as she slid the vibrator into her vagina, the vibration was subtle, but effective. It felt good going in, but she could probably go about her day at this level without anybody noticing.\"Every dollar lets you control it for one second,\" she purred into the camera. The vibrator was synced to her phone, and she could give control to her viewers. \"Subscribers get two seconds. Just be nice to the neighbors, okay?\"She didn't transfer control just yet. She cut off the shower, and made sure that everyone had a good view of her drying herself off. Finally, she stepped out and started to dress herself. Her panties went on first, eyeing the camera with a sultry look, but making sure that the antenna settled nowhere near her clit; she didn't need these people making her lose control completely. She slid a tight pair of shorts on after, and, topless, she smiled at the camera. \"Alright guys, let's introduce our guy to his new neighbor.\"She transferred control to the stream, and the vibrator immediately kicked into full strength. She gasped at the sudden, powerful sensation, and her hand shot between her legs. Struggling to regain her composure, she looked up at her phone and giggled. \"Ooh, I think he liked that.\"She had already harvested twelve hundred dollars, more than half of it from subscribers. Holy shit. The battery would only last for an hour at full strength, but she would be left writhing on the floor of the locker room if she let that continue. Breathing heavy, cheeks already flushed, she straightened up and smiled. Just keep it suppressed, tighten up, and think unsexy thoughts. You can do this. You can't afford not to do this.More money flooded in, and a wave of ecstasy shook her entire body. Her knees buckled, and a yelp of pleasure broke unbidden from her mouth.It was too early. She could not have expected this kind of response on her stream at four in the fucking morning. She struggled desperately to get dressed while acting like everything was normal, but she knew that nobody was buying it from the brutal and unpredictable patterns of the vibrator inside her. She longed to just shut if off but she wasn't sure she could do it discreetly. She just had to make it to her car and finish the ordeal in there.Fuck.\n","The vibration continued, varying in strength and pattern, for far too long. It was annoying, but it wasn't really affecting me. For Renee, however, it was clearly doing something. I could hear her pleasured moans through the flesh and the plastic that surrounded me. I could feel her movements getting more and more erratic, I could even hear her heartbeat gaining in pace and volume.There was nothing comfortable about my situation. My prison was just large enough that her every motion tossed me carelessly up and down, slamming my tiny body into the hard plastic walls that trapped me. The heat was oppressive and the air was stale, but the silver lining was that I didn't have anything to do with whatever stunt she was pulling with the vibrator.She was climaxing for the camera. What else could it be? And she was drawing it out to milk as much money as she could from her viewers. It was pathetic, but I couldn't help but remember that I was her helpless, shrunken sex slave, trapped in a tiny prison that she had shoved up her asshole for fun. Was I really in a place to say that anything she did was pathetic?I had endured Renee's orgasms countless times. I knew the taste of her, the smell of her, I knew everything about what turned her on, I knew the rhythm of her pelvic muscles at the moment of climax better than I knew the national anthem. Here, ensconed in the hard plastic bell of her buttplug, I was spared the brutal experience I had suffered before, the experience of being used as her personal sex toy, and I was relieved for it.Do you want to be Renee's sex toy?If you had asked me that question when the woman had first moved into my apartment, when I first saw that tight ass in short shorts struggling to move a mattress up the stairs, I would have said yes. Absolutely, yes. Yes, forever. The answer still would have been yes when I finally managed to coax that ass into my bed on a Tuesday night. Hell, the answer still would have been yes when I woke up the next morning to that ass sitting on my face. Breakfast in bed.But now I was trapped, thimble-sized, in the tiny plastic chamber of one of Renee's sex toys, shoved directly up that ass. And all I could think was how grateful I was not to be involved with the sex toy that she was actually using at that moment.What a miserable fucking life.So many questions, though. Did anyone know, or care, what she was doing with me? Did they think I went missing, or did they know and just think it was consensual? You couldn't just disappear a person and not leave loose ends, and you sure as hell couldn't livestream that person's tortured existence as your sex toy and not have someone ask questions. And the most obvious question was what the fuck had even happened? I had been shrunk! How was that even possible, and how had a pair of sports medicine undergrad students figured it out? Was it reversible? I didn't even know that shrunken person porn was a thing, but apparently it was a big enough business that both my roommates had an eager, paying audience. Did they have a unique advantage in being able to use an actual shrunken person as their plaything, or was there a whole world of size-related sex slavery that I had been unknowingly plunged into?No answers were forthcoming, obviously. And I suspected that, if these two were smart, they would try their best to keep me from finding any answers. There was a way out of here, there had to be, I knew it, but I would have to fight these giantesses to figure it out. It was hard not to feel helpless, though. I was trapped inside her buttplug, and she had complete control over my size; what fighting could I possibly do?After about twenty minutes of on-and-off vibration, and a little less than five of overblown play-acting at sexual rapture, Renee finally came. I could hear it in her desperate gasps and the rapid pounding of her heart, and feel it in the writhing of her hips and the pulsing of her pelvic muscles. The vibrator cut out abruptly, and, when it was all over, I was finally left in blessed peace.Relative peace, that is. Her body was still an endless source of noise and motion. Now that that was over, though, what did she have in store for me next?*****Renee lay there in the driver's seat of her car, breathing heavy in the afterglow of an orgasm made that much more powerful by her attempts to keep it suppressed. Every second that she had been able to keep the vibrator inside her was more money, and, by her count, she had made more than a thousand dollars since stepping out of the shower. But there was twenty thousand on top of that that she would have no choice but to return. Her hair was a mess, still damp from the shower, her face was flushed, and sweat was beading up on her forehead. She knew she looked like a mess, but she kept the stream live, looking longingly at the dollar value that she had passed up by not being able to keep her lust under control. But, then again, the number of donations that had come in would have kept the vibrator in her viewers' control for more than eight hours. Eight hours! She couldn't even imagine edging herself for that long, let alone subjecting herself to a vibrator as strong as this one.Next time she'd use a weaker vibrator. Maybe keep her own control over it as well without telling anyone.\"Whoo,\" she gasped, looking at the camera with a sultry grin. \"You really know how to please a woman...\" She took a deep breath, and let it out in a sigh, and tilted the camera down to her crotch. Her shorts were around her knees, but her panties were still on, and the wet spot between her legs was plain for all to see. \"That was just too much. If you didn't get a chance to control it, you'll get your money back, don't worry. But, for now...\"She lifted her hips off the car seat and, with her free hand, dug into the back of her underwear, spreading her legs as much as she could to get access to the plug still in her asshole. \"Let's take a look at our little buddy and see how he's doing.\"She pulled the toy out and crashed down onto the seat, setting the phone carefully on the dash so it could keep filming. A pungent smell followed the plug when she lifted it out of her panties, but nobody could smell it on the stream, so it didn't matter. She unscrewed the base and tipped the shrunken man out and into her open palm. \"Was that fun?\" she asked him. \"Did you enjoy working out with me?\"He didn't respond, and he didn't have to. She looked up at the camera, \"I think he's jealous of the vibrator,\" she said. She lowered him down onto the seat between her legs and slouched forwards, presenting him face-to-face with a wet spot that was as big as he was. \"I was thinking about you the whole time, little guy, do you see that? You got me all worked up...\"She pulled down the waistband of her panties, exposing her pussy to him, and to the stream. It was still flushed red, and smeared with slimy lubricant, from the furious ride to orgasm that she had titillated her viewers with. She grabbed the phone and brought the camera down so that the viewers could see it, and him, up close and personal. \"Don't worry,\" she cooed, \"I kept it nice and warm for you.\" She stroked the flesh delicately with the back of the thumb that was holding open the waistband, \"Mmm, and wet... Why don't you try a taste?\"It would have been best for her if he just took the fucking cue and stepped up into her open panties so she could wrap the stream up quickly, but he was still reticent. After a moment, she reached behind him and tapped him on the ass with her middle finger, and he tumbled forwards into the cotton hammock.She let the waistband snap shut without even checking to make sure he was in the right spot, and giggled, \"Oh my God!\" she exclaimed, raising the camera to her face so nobody could see her reaching down to adjust him, \"He just jumped right in! I didn't know he was that eager.\"Once she had him safely tucked away between her labia, squarely situated right over the wet spot in her underwear, she lowered the camera back down to her crotch. \"Can you see him down there? How are you doing, little guy?\" she asked in a singsong voice. \"I think he likes it,\" she said, looking at the camera as she raised it to give her audience a view of her entire body. \"I can feel him moving down there... Oh!\"She straightened up abruptly, letting out a quiet gasp in a totally fabricated moment of pleasured surprise. Even if her little toy was moving down there, she could barely feel him, and he sure wouldn't be able to work her to orgasm on his own. But the viewers didn't have to know that. With some convincing moans and spasmodic convulsions, she could convince them that the tiny man was pushing all of her buttons in all the right ways. After cumming on camera once already, genuinely, she didn't even have to pretend to reach orgasm. She could just dangle his future as a pleasurable irritant out there, and people would lap it up.\"Oh, you are jealous of the vibrator, aren't you?\" she asked. She let out another gasp and tightened up, gripping the car seat. \"Ohh... Keep that up...\"She ground her hips around a little, knowing full well that she was squishing him between her body and the leather seat beneath her. She kept the camera close up on her gyrating hips, so people could see the torture she was putting him through. \"He's definitely having fun down there,\" she purred. \"But if he's not careful... Oh!\"She gave her hips a little twitch to accompany the gasp. If nothing else, she knew how to fake an orgasm. She let out a loose, husky giggle, \"Oohhh, if he's not careful... Things might get really wet down there, little guy!\"Renee lifted the camera back up to her face, chewing thoughtfully on her lip and looking off into the distance. \"I think... I think I can do this all day,\" she whispered, as if sharing a dirty secret. \"If he keeps this up...\" She closed her eyes and let out a shuddering gasp. \"Oh, we're gonna have fun,\" she said, pouring as much lust into her expression as she could manage. \"Tune in later.\" She was barely subvocalizing at this point, the camera only inches from her face. \"We'll see how he does.\"With the push of a button, Renee cut the stream and put the phone down. She transitioned from sex-desperate succubus to normality in an instant, sliding her pants all the way up and reaching to put her shirt back on. She didn't even bother addressing her little toy anymore; now that the camera was off, he didn't even exist to her. She'd cut up the stream later, publish it as a standalone video, and then start a new one later today.She put her seatbelt on and threw the car into drive. Right. Workout done, stream done, but class didn't start for nearly two hours. Might as well grab breakfast. *****Knocked unexpectedly in the back, I tumbled forwards into the giantess' panties, and, as soon as I hit the cotton surface, she let the waistband snap shut, and I was slammed brutally into the bulk of her body.Renee wasn't done, though. I heard her speaking, but couldn't make out the words over the rustling of fingers against fabric, as she reached down to adjust my position to the most sadistic location possible. My back rubbed painfully across sandpaper stubble as she slid me down, headfirst, until my entire body had slipped between the lips of her labia. The heat was incredible. Slimy fluid coated my entire body and filled my mouth with every breath. Soft flesh wrapped eagerly around my tiny form, as if it was trying to swallow me whole, and the wet cotton of her underwear kept me pinned up against it. Even if I tried to move to escape, or even to work my way to a more comfortable position, the slick flesh around me and the pressure of the panties at my face would conspire to force me to sink deeper in. It was a miserable, miserable place to be. At this size, her vagina was an instrument of exquisite torture; the only saving grace was that I was facing away from it. I could hear her speaking, at least a bit, and then her hips tilted downwards abruptly. Her weight shifted, and suddenly it was all centered on top of me. The soft flesh of her vulva bore down on my back like a car rolling over me. My ears rang, the blood pounding in my head at the sudden, massive increase in pressure, and all I could hear was my own heartbeat, competing with the one that pulsed insistently through the giantess' flesh against my body.Trapped beneath her mountainous bulk, I could feel her speak more than hear it, and I was certain that it was little more than fake sex sounds. Oh, do you like that, you bitch? What part of this is getting you off? The fact that I'm not moving, or the fact that I literally can't?Knowing her, it was probably actually the latter. Nothing like casually torturing your roommate, right?After a few moments, she started to grind her hips around, probably still showing off for the camera. But, already pinned beneath all one million tons of her, and with her panties saving me from being rubbed brutally against the leather of her car seat, it wasn't that much worse. I could feel the motion, I could hear the deafening squeaking and rubbing sounds of her body against leather, and the blazing hot flesh of her vulva pressed down mercilessly on my diminutive figure. My life was miserable, but her moving around didn't make my life any more miserable.But what I knew, what I dreaded, was that, in this position, I was totally helpless to her whims, and to the whims of her viewers. If she thought it would be entertaining to them, or even just pleasurable for her, she could reach down into my hot, fluid-filled world and shove my entire body into her vagina effortlessly. It was the only thing she could do to make things worse for me, but she could do it instantly and without warning.So, every time I heard her speak, every time I felt her move, it came with a sense of dread, a fear that this would be the time that she decided to step it up. This would be the moment that she would confine me to the muscular prison between her legs. It didn't happen, not even when she fell silent and slouched down into her car seat, relieving me of the pressure of her body weight. But I still knew that she could, and that she would without warning and seemingly without reason.I was already subjected to brutal heat, intense pressure, and a seemingly never-ending world of bodily fluids. Eventually, I just wanted her to get it over with. Just shove me into your vagina, you bitch, and forget about me. I couldn't believe that that was my greatest hope right now. There had to be a way out of this.\n","Renee knew how to ham up a performance for a livestream, but she also knew how to draw one out for a video drop. And she knew that there were supporters who loved a exhibitionist display so much that she didn't even need to get naked for it. Halfway through her drive to class, she pulled off onto the weed-strewn driveway of an abandoned video store, and swung her car around behind the building before pulling to a stop. Gravel crunched, brakes squeaked, and the shrunken man stirred briefly against her crotch, and then there was a sudden silence.This was about as private as she could get in a public setting. She could do some pretty unforgivable things to the shrunken man that was trapped in her panties from here. But, after the brutal sexual exercise she had endured for the sake of the stream just minutes before, the very last thing she wanted to do was use her little slave for her own pleasure. Hell, she barely even wanted him in her panties, stirring up against the sore and sensitive flesh between her legs.What she wanted, right now, was to chuck him into the woods and let the raccoons feast on his tiny body. Be done with him forever. But she knew that that was just a lingering manifestation of her post-orgasm guilt, just as her previous ravenous appetite for new and inventive ways to use his body had just been her libido speaking.But she had a job to do, didn't she? A job that transcended her horny impulses or her post-coital guilt. She swung open the door and walked over to the trunk of her car, where she kept extra sets of clothes, for whatever occasion her stream might require of her.In the relative privacy of an abandoned parking lot behind a video store, Renee slipped off her shoes, shimmied off her shorts, and pulled a skimpy skirt out of her trunk. She pulled the skirt up, buttoned it closed, and then grabbed her phone to take a quick picture from between her legs.Standing barefoot in the lot, she studied the picture carefully, zooming in on the tiny bulge in her underwear. It was decently visible, but she wasn't sure the shape, and the location, was favorable to the video that she wanted to record. She hopped up to sit on the trunk of her car, spread her legs a bit, and took another photo, to see what it would look like if she filmed from underneath her desk at class.She pored over the picture for a minute or two, zooming in on the important parts with a shamelessness that would have shocked her own self barely two years ago. After a moment of studying the contours that the tiny man's body drew against the crotch of her underwear, she decided that, yeah, that was good enough. At least for the low-effort sort of video drop she had in mind. So she dusted off her feet, slid her shoes back on, and got back in the car. She waited barely five minutes before she started recording for the drop; editing may be a pain in the ass, but it was always better to have more footage to work with. She had another twenty minutes in her drive, so she could try a few times at the scene she envisioned as being the 'naughty reveal in the car' intro.\"So, look, I've got to get to class,\" she said, speaking in a low tone, as if confiding a secret to the camera. \"And I don't normally do this, but...\" She bit her lip, looking off as if uncertain whether or not to share in the first place. \"I've decided to bring my little friend along for the ride.\"She flashed the camera on her phone between her her legs, just for a moment, just long enough that they would see the bulge of the shrunken man in her panties. She shifted her legs a little bit when she did so, just because a bit of motion made the macro part of it play better. With that done, she pointed the camera back at her own face. \"Maybe he'll learn some calculus with me,\" she said with a giggle.She cut the camera there. It wasn't much, maybe ninety seconds, but it would make for a good intro to a ten-minute video. She already knew what that video would look like: plenty of naughty looks, upskirts, and a few shots of her brushing her fingers across the lump of the tiny man caught in her panties. The end would obviously be a few minutes of masturbating to orgasm, either with the shrunken man or through him. The challenge, for most of it, was getting footage in a surreptitious way while on campus. Every shot she could get on a crowded sidewalk, a busy hallway, or a packed classroom was priceless. With all those people who had no idea that there was a shrunken man between her legs around her, her viewers had the privilege of knowing a secret; a dirty, dirty secret; that the rest of the world did not.But what kind of woman walked around with their phone camera pointed up her own skirt? The very thing that made the exhibitionism so appealing made it too embarrassing for her to get caught recording it, even for a girl as shameless in front of the camera as she was. And, what's worse, what really made recording her... activities... challenging, was the fact that a good part of what she was doing was almost certainly illegal.She reached the next stoplight, and turned her phone camera back on, then spread her legs to give it a good view up her skirt. \"Do you see him?\" she asked, in a voice that practically dripped with eroticism. \"He's coming for a little ride with me.\" She shifted her hips a bit, then drew the camera up to her face, \"We've got a few hours of classwork to do together. Do you think he's up for it?\"She got another shot between her legs, and, this time, she ground her hips into her car seat a little, just to show the viewers that, at his size and in his position, he wasn't up for it. \"I think he likes it,\" she said to the camera. She gasped in surprise, even though nothing had happened, \"Oh, he's struggling! I think he liked that... We'll see...\"With a sultry look at the camera, she ended the recording. That would do for now. She could get more footage later, but she had this nagging sense in her mind that every second of footage, especially the footage she threw up online, was just digging herself a deeper legal hole. What would happen when the hammer fell? Well, it was too late, at this point, to stop now. The only reason she kept it up like this was that almost nobody knew that what she was doing was illegal. And those who did weren't really even sure. With a shrunken man serving her every whim, acting as her toy for the entertainment of thousands of strangers, Renee was working in a very gray legal zone. But the fact that her little slave was there, presumably, against his will made her position decidedly illegal, or at least so she had been told.The real complication was the shrinking procedure. There was no way that the little man remembered, but he had agreed, while absolutely shit-hammered, to being shrunk. What he didn't know, and what Paige barely understood, was that he was buying himself into a world of silent, unwitting, and unlimited consent. In a very practical sense, a shrunken man could never say \"no,\" at least while his public presence was under the strict control of his giant mistress. And the cottage industry of size-related porn had emerged from a dark world of technology that very few people even knew about. Renee had no way to know the full extent of the world she had bought herself into, but she did know that it was small. It was large enough to pay the bills; fabulously well, in fact; but it was still fairly small.Small enough to avoid media scrutiny. Small enough to avoid serious legal strictures. So the thirty-second blurry smartphone video she had of the shrunken man agreeing in slurred tones to be shrunken down into a sex toy was all she needed. A paper-thin legal cover, and hours upon hours of explicitly pornographic, arguably non-consensual video.There was no way it would last, she knew. But she was making a lot of money. Even now, she had already accumulated the kind of cash pool that normal people spent their entire careers building up, and she had just turned twenty-three. If she just carried on this way through to the end of college, she could leave the country and live on investment income for the rest of her life. But it still nagged at her. She knew she couldn't trust the viewership counts, either on her stream or on her uploads, but the money was definitely real. That spoke to either a very large community, or a very wealthy one. How, then, did it seem to avoid public scrutiny to the point that nobody bothered asking whether or not the shrunken man was a willing participant in all this? Or maybe they did, and the shadowy world that had developed the pill that she had fed to her little toy while he had been full-sized managed to keep her insulated from the controversy.The more she thought about it, the more she wanted to just call it quits now, and go back to something like a normal life. But then what would she do with the shrunken man? And all those hours of video already floating around out there? Maybe she could bring the tiny man with her when she fled to the Caymans. Putting aside his usefulness as a video prop, he actually did occasionally make for a fun sex toy. But Kristi had split the initial investment with her, and she enjoyed using the little man as much as Renee did, so they'd have to come to some agreement. Maybe overnight mail?She finally pulled into the campus parking lot, about a thousand miles away from her classroom, but, before she cut the engine, she flicked the camera back on for the last little snippet of video. \"Hey, there!\" she said in a bubbly voice, looking down at the camera that she held between her legs. On the selfie cam, she had an unflattering view up her skirt, the rest of her body towering overhead. Did the whole world look like that to the tiny man? Or was there something more profound about the ant's-eye view that the camera just couldn't capture?\"I'm about to head to class, but I thought...\" she bit her lip, looking off as if she was a bit guilty about what she was going to say. Then she tilted the camera so it could see right up her skirt. \"You all should see where he is. He's gonna study with me!\"She giggled,     and, with her free hand, reached under her skirt and pulled her panties to the side. The shrunken man, previously stuck unrelentingly to her crotch, tumbled out into the palm of her hand. \"There he is!\" she exclaimed, lifting both him and the camera up to her face. She dangled him upside-down by his feet, swinging him back and forth right beside her face, one eye on the camera to make sure that he stayed center frame. \"I know you guys are jealous. Who wouldn't want to be him?\"Renee turned her gaze on the tiny man, dangling upside-down barely an inch from her face, and gave him a little kiss. She made a show of thinking for a moment, then licked his entire body from head to toe. \"Is that what I taste like?\" she asked, to nobody in particular. \"Do you like it, little guy?\"The tiny man managed to get enough control of his flailing body to toss her the bird, so she immediately dunked him back down between her legs. \"Oh, he likes it,\" she moaned, tilting the camera back down under her skirt.Her hand, and the tiny man pinned between her fingers, were deep below the waistband of her panties. That thin layer of cloth was a curtain, and anyone who could see what the camera saw could only imagine what was happening behind it. Her fingertips had absolute control over his tiny body, like rolling a grain of rice against her skin, and that kind of power really sent her blood pumping.At a whim, she could toss him into her mouth and swallow him. She could leave him trapped between the cotton of her underwear and the heat of her pussy. She could shove him deep into her asshole, or her vagina, or she could flick him underneath the passenger seat and forget about him forever. His fate was literally in her hands, and that knowledge was truly intoxicating.And he probably hated what was happening to him. That's what made it really fun. She rubbed his tiny, helpless body against her clit for a few seconds, just until it started to feel good, and then slid him down and shoved him into her own vagina, sizing him down as she did so until he was smaller than her fingernail. She only went as deep as the second knuckle, so that she knew he would be secure no matter shat she did, then withdrew her hand.She followed her right hand with the camera as she lifted it out from underneath her panties and up to her face, and cast the lens a hungry, desperate expression, and shoved her fluid-coated fingers into her mouth.Renee sucked on her fingers for a few short seconds, drawing every drop of fluid that coated them down her throat, desperate for any taste of the tiny man that she had completely dominated. Then she dropped her hand and looked dead at the camera again, \"I don't know if I can do this,\" she whispered. \"He feels really good...\" She giggled, biting her tongue and acting like she was caught between ecstasy and shame, and covered her mouth with the palm of her hand. \"If he keeps squirming like this...\" She looked away from the camera, and made a show of feeling pleasure that didn't exist. He was way too small by now for her to even notice that he was inside her anymore. \"Fuck it,\" she said, grinning ear to ear, \"Let's do it.\"She threw open the car door and stepped out, trying to keep the camera stable and pointed at her hips. \"Alright, little guy,\" she said to nobody in particular, \"Behave.\"She slung her bag over her shoulder, then lowered the phone so the camera was looking up between her legs again. She couldn't leave it there for long, not in public, she just needed a few moments of her walking around. Not daring to look down at the selfie cam, she straightened out her skirt and bumped the car door shut with her hips, then took a few exaggerated steps towards her classroom, flexing her ass and swaying her hips deliberately as she did so.She couldn't think of a good transition, so she just cut the video there.  I had spent weeks, maybe months inside Renee's vagina by now. Between her streaming and her own personal depravity, she filled far more of her time with sex than any human being I had ever met before, more than I would have thought possible when I had first met her. And, of course, I got a front-row seat to all of it, a helpless observer or, more often, an unwilling participant. But, even for a creature of her seemingly limitless appetites, the fact was that most of her life was not spent in the throes of lust.And so, in a way, being trapped inside her vagina was a sort of privacy. It was horrifically uncomfortable, claustrophobic beyond belief and nothing I could do would ever make it better, but it was possible to get used to it after a while. Unlike anywhere else, I knew I was safe here. Protected by flesh, by clothing, and the fact that it was generally socially unacceptable to go digging around inside your underwear in public. Unlike when it had just been me, her, and her streaming audience alone in her car. She toyed with me like a cat with its prey, ripping me across infinite space in moments, mercilessly subjecting me to whatever part of her body she felt like it at the time, totally careless of the limitations of my own tiny body. And why should she care? What should have crushed my bones and torn my limbs apart was just a discomfort to me, a discomfort that she would never feel, so why spare me from it?When she finally decided that she was done playing with me, she rubbed me up against her pussy for a few seconds, and I was scared that she was going to start masturbating again. There couldn't be anything particularly exciting about having a squirming, shrunken person between your fingers and your clit when you were rubbing yourself off, but she seemed to enjoy it. Fortunately, she didn't bother.  Instead, she just shoved me carelessly into her vagina, guiding my legs into the burning hot tunnel of flesh, pulling her hand an inch back, and putting her fingers on my shoulders to shove me all the way in. A two-step motion of terrifying complexity and scale that she did effortlessly, in less time than it took to describe it. When her fingers departed my new world of infinite heat and fluid, and the walls slowly tightened up around me, I finally noticed that she had shrunken me again. A lot. Last time she had left me inside her vagina for so long that she had been forced to find a new spot for me for her period, but I had been four, maybe five inches tall then. Now, I was so small that even that a person of that size would seem giant to me. Of course, my diminished size still didn't spare me the pressure of the fleshy walls, which squeezed down around me now that the massive bulk of her fingers had departed. It didn't help me escape the suffocating heat, and it didn't make it any easier to find a pocket where I could breathe more air than the slimy fluid that filled my world. If anything, it made everything more difficult. It took every ounce of my strength to press against the walls that surrounded me, and even then, the plaint, lubricant-soaked flesh absorbed my every move like quicksand, pressing down around every curve of my body like a latex glove.It was easier to just lie there, upside-down and spread-eagled, more or less in the same position and spot as she had left me, with the pressure of the walls around me holding in me in place through the rough and unpredictable motion of her body outside. It left me feeling uncomfortably like luggage.No, not even luggage. I had been luggage when I was bigger, but she had shrunken me down so much that the only time she would think about me would be to wonder if I was even still there. I was nothing more than a part of her body now. A completely insignificant part, and I had as much say over what she did as any other part. Miles and miles away, across a seemingly infinite expanse of flesh, her head was doing the driving, and I was just along for the ride. Suddenly, the relatively safe space of her vagina felt a whole lot less safe. Whatever her body did to me here, it would do it almost completely without her knowledge, and I would be carried along like an ant in a rainstorm. What would happen? And what would happen to me? Would I be lost deeper inside her, or would I be lost to the harsh infinity of the outside world?\n"],["Once, long long ago, there stood a town called Windermere. Within the grand and open world it stood as a quaint little town comprised mostly of farmhands and tailors, secluded from the rest of the world amongst mountain ranges. But despite this isolation it was a happy place, with happy, simple people. A perfectly idyllic place forever destined to live as it always had for all of time. Not that that would be a bad thing.\nThe town was a place basked in tradition and routine. Each day was spent tending to the fields and each night was spent with friends and family. Once per every fortnight the town would gather to its central monument, a tower dedicated to their Gods, and would pray for success and happiness. The monument was the adhesive that kept the community together through even the harshest of winters and conflicts.\nThen she arrived.\nLike all places Windermere had its fair share of fantastical tales: Dragons soaring through the heavens, Nymphs in the woods, Harpies in the mountains. Stories that were meant to inspire values and teach lessons, but never to be taken seriously. So much time had passed since the days of old that nobody truly believed in such tales anymore. Not until confronted with undeniable proof.\nIt is said that the day began like any other. The sun rose and birds chirped while the town was slowly awakening to a new day of more of the same. But as the sun rose yonder into the sky the ground shook and trembled. Initially people assumed it was an earthquake, but it was unlike any earthquake they had ever known. The tremors barely lasted a moment and then would happen again and again in a rhythm, steadily getting louder and stronger. Eventually one villager caught sight of the source: a giant.\nShe was unlike any story they had heard before. Giants were often described in the olden tales as grotesque and vile, usually with one eye; a hideous abomination of nature in the mocking image of man. The sort of creature one might scare their child by saying it would come for them if they were naughty. But approaching was instead a beautiful woman no different from the villagers were it naught for her charming appearance and scale. It is said some fell for her on the spot, hypnotized by the brilliant blue eyes that looked down from on high.\nSome likened it to the arrival of a natural born goddess. Her towering figure stood just above forty meters high. A flawless face framed by long, flowing blonde hair and bearing a brilliant smile. She appeared to be wearing common clothing of wool and linen, lined with trace amounts of light armor. A sword rested at her side, larger than any building in all of Windermere. The typical garb one might expect of a wanderer or adventurer.\nQuestions quickly arose amongst the populace. Who was this woman? What was she? Friend or Foe?\nThe answer came sooner than they would have liked as her foot came down upon one of the local homes. A building that took weeks of communal effort ended with a mere step of her boot. Less than a second and yet nothing was left but rubble and wooden planks. Praise the Gods that the residents were out in the fields as it happened.\nWhat happened immediately after remains unclear, lost to time. Some stories say the giant quickly and very half-heartedly apologized. Others say she laughed and had a scary grin on her visage. But what is known is that she began to speak to the people. She asked simple and rather natural questions. What was the village’s name? Why were they so separated from the world? Despite having the presence of a monster she appeared to act quite civilly. Almost unnervingly so.\nOnce her queries were answered she had but one simple request: to meet with the village elder for what she deemed “negotiations”. Whether out of concern for their leader or suddenly driven to recklessness by fear, several townsfolk grew angered, daring to bare their pitchforks and farm tools up against the giant.\n“Go ahead. Do your worst.” She allegedly laughed and brought her boot down before the group. Enraged by the woman’s audacity the small group attacked with all their might, achieving nothing for all their pride and bravado. The worn leather of her footwear was durable and caused most of the makeshift weapons to snap upon impact. But it is said however that one weapon wielded by the strongest man in the village pierced all the way through to the foot within. To which he only got one simple response.\n“That tickles.”\nThe sobering realization of their utter helplessness quickly led to the people throwing down their weapons. With nothing left but desperate hope they turned to their god’s monument for support, praying for a miracle.\nShe merely laughed at their pathetic display. “You think such a puny god can stand up to me?” At her monstrous height she easily towered over the religious idol. She bent down and placed her hands around it, uprooting it from the ground effortlessly. “Allow me to make myself clear for you all.” The blonde giant smiled softly and proceeded to break the monument over her knee, much to the horror of the villagers.\n“Now I repeat. Bring me your leader.” The giant ordered impatiently as she tossed the broken fragments far away.\n“I am already here.” One man stepped forward. The same man in fact who legends say pierced the giant’s boot. A simple man they called Hue. “What is your name Giant? And why do you trouble our village so?”\n“Alexandra.” She replied with a soft smile. “And we have much to discuss. Come with me.”\nWhat happened next remains unknown to all but the giant and Hue. The giant known as Alexandra left the village whilst carrying the village elder in her palm. For ten days and ten nights they did not return. Unease quickly spread throughout the town. What if the giant had simply killed him and went to inform her fellow giants of a new stomping ground? Countless stories and rumors spread, all showcasing their fear for Alexandra. But as the eleventh day’s sun rose these fears were realized to be unfounded with the pair’s return. During their meetings they had managed to reach an agreement.\nIt was decided between the two during their many talks over the days that Windermere would house Alexandra. They would show her respect and help care for her, and in return she would offer knowledge from the outside world and protect them all from would be invaders. But this news was nothing compared to the one caveat that followed.\nIt was also decided that once per year Alexandra would choose a single resident of the village as her personal Attendant. This Attendant would do everything she commanded and would care for all her needs as she desired. It is said that this was the one point the giant absolutely refused to budge on, going even so far as to threaten crushing the entire village were the condition not met. Thus, Hue hesitantly agreed. It remained far from ideal but in exchange for this one term the rest of the village would remain safe and even prosper with Alexandra’s wisdom and power. Without much choice the terms were accepted and Hue volunteered to be the first Attendant as a show of good faith.\nA few details have long since been lost to history but this tale was what began a tradition that has lasted for centuries. This is the story that has been passed down since that faithful day almost two hundred years ago. Since then Windermere, with the exception of Attendants, has only prospered and grown. Alexandra’s knowledge of the outside world allowed for improved farming techniques, sturdier buildings, and so much more.\n \nYet, at this very moment there was a general unease within Windermere. After all, within a week it was going to be the selection of the 200th Attendant. The anniversary of the 200th year that Alexandra had been with them. Which meant that soon one of them would be leaving to join the giant’s side once again.\n \n","It was so odd to know the legends surrounding the giant known as Alexandra and yet bear witness to the scene before him. Of course it was nothing new, but with some reflection on the fable it was a true testament to how much time had passed since those olden days.\nThe children shrieked with their overly high pitched voices and ran as if their lives depended on it. It took but a glance to understand why as the blonde giant was hot on their trail. “Oh no you don’t!” She flashed a toothy grin and gave chase. That is, if chase meant taking very slow and prolonged steps so her boots always fell shy of the fleeing youths.\nOne of the children, a little girl, dared to turn her head to see how close Alexandra was to the group. Her gaze met with the bottom of a worn boot that, if legends were to be believed, had ended hundreds of lives in the past. Her shriek was especially loud as she picked up speed. Yet the boot was simply too big for them and its shadow overcame the group. The boot lowered slowly, touching their small heads with her sole.\n“Tag!” Alexandra said triumphantly and pulled her foot back; laughing at the children she so effortlessly knocked over. None seemed hurt, only a bit mussed.\nThe whole scene was heartwarming as the children clambered back to their feet and proceeded to chase the casually walking giant. Especially to Emil, one of the many onlookers who watched the scene unfold. With the safety of the children guaranteed many released the breath they had been holding and continued along their merry way. All but Emil who maintained his gaze upon the giant haughtily taunting the kids who failed to keep up.\nWere the stories to be believed Alexandra was well over several hundred years old, yet she didn’t seem to have aged a day past twenty. Despite all that time spent on this world she maintained a youthful visage, beautiful and elegant with naught but jovial warmth in her eyes. A face set in a seemingly permanent smile, framed by braided blonde hair. Even as she groaned once a child finally managed to tag her the smile refused to completely fade away.\nBy comparison Emil lacked in all areas, a plain face with plain brown hair and an altogether not too impressive physique to boot. Dark brown eyes that seemed to always add a bit of a snark to his otherwise drole expression. He truly was the embodiment of the modest little farmhand he was, and he was completely fine with that. His eyes lingered on Alexandra and the children for a long moment as he finally begrudgingly turned to walk back home.\n“You’re never gonna catch me, Goddess or not!” A child’s voice screamed loud enough for all to hear and brought a small smile to Emil’s dopey face.\nIt was difficult to say when it had happened, but at some point during the centuries that Alexandra had watched over Windermere her name and God or Goddess had grown interchangeable. Not that she or anybody else seemed to mind it. It was usually just something the children said, Emil himself was guilty of calling her by that in his youth. Simply hearing it was enough to allow him to briefly reflect in nostalgia on those simpler days.\nSince her arrival Windermere had changed substantially. The simple little village with little more than huts and fields was now a town proper, complete with cobblestone roads and houses supported with wooden beams and brick. Farming and tailoring remained the trades of choice and had long since become the biggest industries in town. Thanks in no small part to the extra-large mouth to feed and clothe.\nFeeling the ground shake beneath his feet, Emil turned a quick eye over to the source and found Alexandra sitting atop the local brewery. The building creaked beneath her weight but somehow held fast as it always had. From within the building a familiar hulking figure could be seen lugging out a barrel over his shoulder. He was an attractive man with long, dark hair and rippling muscles. A year ago the man was Andrei: strongest man in the village and the best damned farmer one could have ever imagined. But now he was Andrei: Attendant to the great and powerful Alexandra.\nThe Attendant was too far to overhear his words but he appeared to be offering the barrel to his giant master. In a fluid motion deceptively fast for her size Alexandra’s hands quickly snagged it. She hoisted it over her open mouth and clenched her fist, allowing the gallons of ale that filled the barrel to rain down into her gaping maw before casually tossing the splintered wood aside. A large, pink tongue licked the extra droplets along her lips happily.\nEmil shrugged and continued walking the other way, overhearing Alexandra’s loud demand of “Another!” from behind.\nEven with its developments over the years Windermere was still a small town all things considered. It took no time at all before Emil navigated his way home, his thoughts on the big event coming tomorrow.\nThe end of the final week of the year was nearing and with it a new Attendant would be chosen. Soon Andrei would be relieved of his duty. Though they would never speak it aloud many of the townsfolk were nervous that they or their children would be selected next.\nTo be Alexandra’s Attendant is to be removed from everyone. A person’s life no longer becomes about a trade and instead becomes about her. In exchange for servicing her for a year she remains satisfied and doesn’t bring her wrath down upon the town. One person’s sacrifice for the wellbeing of everyone. Perhaps not a perfect system, but it was simply the way things were; and it would’ve taken a much greater man than he to try and fix what wasn’t broken.\nNot that Emil was even slightly concerned with it. After all, he was confident there was no way he’d be chosen. He was neither the strongest, smartest, handsomest, nor the most charming lad in town. He was simply a farm boy who blended into the scenery, practically human window dressing. Not even worth the giant’s time, content to sit back and let tradition play out once more as he minded his own business.\nRegardless, involved or not, tomorrow would mark a historic day for Windermere.\nThough these were thoughts he cast aside for later. What was much more pressing was tonight’s party. A two-hundred year anniversary didn’t come every day after all.\n \n","Emil couldn’t have hid the grin on his face even if he tried. Even knowing what tomorrow would bring there was naught but merriment and splendor in the air to the point it would practically be a sin to not be enjoying one’s self.\nThe young man was seated calmly at a table near an inconspicuous corner, drinking in the sights before him. In seemingly no time since his walk earlier the town square had been transformed into the center of one of the largest parties in Windermere history. Every person in the town, be they man, woman, or child, was present and stupidly drunk as can be. Each moment seemed to bring a new wave of roaring laughter and bumbling accidents all to the upbeat tune of the few musicians eagerly playing all their favorites.\n“…And then it was just me. My comrades were down and the dragon was all that stood between us and our mission.”\nThen of course there was Alexandra. She was no exception to the merriment. If anything she seemed to be having more fun than anyone. The flawless fair skin had long since turned red with countless barrels of ale, but nonetheless her Attendant constantly moved to bring her more. Surrounding her was a crowd of people, mostly children.\n“Twas a fearsome creature! A full head taller than me and breathing fire that melted my blade right down to the hilt. Everyone had been bested and all I had were my fists and wits about me.”\n“What happened then?” A child asked the giant, one of about a couple dozen who listened to Alexandra’s story with clear awe. Emil smirked, remembering how the last time she had told the story the dragon was in fact shorter than her.\nAlexandra grinned and rocked back on the building she sat on, sounding off a series of creaks from the makeshift seat. “Why I did what I do best child. I rushed the monster head on!” Various oohs and ahhs quickly followed. “He seemed barely winded thus far and met my aggression with his own. Jaws stronger than a castle’s walls came for my throat, but then I avoided them at the last second and wrapped my arms around the creature’s slimy neck! He did his best to thrash me off but we both knew who the victor was.” The blonde giant’s chest puffed with pride as she laughed.\n“How did you beat him? Wasn’t your sword melted?”\nEmil’s grin matched Alexandra’s as she gave her famed conclusion. Under his breath he mouthed it along with her. “Why I ripped his neck apart with my bare teeth!” For effect she leaned forward and brought her head near the cluster of youths and adults, chomping the pearly whites loudly. The entire group cried out and quickly burst into laughter. “For the record he tasted awful. Easily the worst creature I’ve eaten.”\n“Here you go.” A gruff voice raised itself to a shout to garner the giant’s attention. Her blue eyes casually glanced over to her Attendant. “Good. Before you get the next one a while ago someone spilled their drink on my boot. Take care of it.” She quickly ordered before downing the container of alcohol into her mouth. Nobody else seemed to so much as notice the young man who had delivered it, least of all Alex once her drink was done.\nSuch was the fate of Attendants Emil lamented. It was a popular myth that associating with an Attendant was grounds for being selected as the next one. As such they were often treated as outcasts, no matter how beloved they were before. Andrei was the apple of everyone’s eye once upon a time. Now it was only Emil who dared to look at him from the safety of his hidden corner.\nThe hulking man stepped towards Alexandra’s boots and quickly found the wet splotch of beer near the top its toe. Once upon a time he would have been too proud to even consider what he was about to do, but now he knelt down without hesitation and brought his lips to the footwear. Out of consideration Emil looked away, knowing full well he was now licking up the filth from the giant’s foot. Some stories even said that was how Attendants ate.\nNobody seemed to pay him any mind however. Alexandra was quick to get into a new story about how she swam her way to the bottom of the ocean to find the kingdom of Aquaria. Likewise the crowd moved along with it, but Emil tuned it out and focused on his own drink. Everyone was quick to move on from anything to do with Andrei.\nEmil was fully content to just casually enjoy his drinks and food while basking in everyone else’s good time. Such was the sort of man he was. A fly on the wall as it were. He could spy the elders of the village happily chatting at the largest table, the farmers and their respective wives dancing crudely, and of course the children and their stories told by an increasingly drunk giant.\nOnly one person was not having fun: Andrei. Emil turned his dark eyes to the burly man once more, noting the resigned exhaustion in his visage. While this was a day off for everyone for him it was the hardest day he’d ever have to work. Whether it was from pity or stubborn kindness Emil found himself walking over to him.\nInitially Andrei paid Emil no mind. Next to no one had approached him all year. Why would they start now? You’d have to be an absolute idiot to want to risk being associated with an Attendant. A sentiment his expression conveyed to Emil almost instantly once he realized who the young man was looking at.\n“Here.” Emil offered his mug to the dumbfounded Attendant.\nHis face, weary from the year of endless labor and stress, stared down at Emil’s hand. “What are you…?”\n“You look thirsty.” He smiled innocently in response. “Plus with what’ll happen tomorrow…It’s the least I can do. Quickly, before Alexandra notices you slacking off.”\nAndrei didn’t need to be told twice. Emil barely blinked before the mug was being downed by the muscular man. A moment later the empty mug was shoved back in his hands. “You’re a fool. But appreciated uh…” He blinked and stared intently at Emil’s face. “…Errol right?”\n“Emil, but close enough.” He shrugged. “It’s the least I can do for all you’ve done for the town.”\nThe Attendant didn’t answer and approached another barrel, tossing it over his shoulder with seemingly no effort. “It’s been too long since I had beer.” He licked his lips. “Beats her foot grime any day.” Andrei laughed and headed out, reinvigorated with a bit of the brew in his throat.\nEmil walked off as well, but not before sharing a glance with Andrei. The man’s eyes conveyed his deep gratitude better than a thousand words. Even if nobody gave him the time of day at least one very foolish person did him a last kindness.\nThe party continued well into the night. Hours passed with everyone having the time of their lives. Eventually however, the guest of honor had to leave.\n“Sh-orry everybody, but I gotta rest up for tomorrow.” Alexandra slurred her way through every word, weaving back in forth in place. The giant reached her hand down for her Attendant who silently clambered on. Emil watched carefully as she slid him into one of her trouser pockets. “Make shore everything is ready!~” The blonde giant then rose to her feet and everyone knew better than to be near her for this.\nShe took the first of many intoxicated steps away and grabbed a building for support. Shingles rained down from the roof onto the streets. Then with her next step she did the same, her thumb penetrating a window of the next building. “Ah Seven Hells. I’ll fix that tomorrow.” Her next step saw a cart snapped to splinters under her foot. “That too!” Alexandra drunkenly apologized and continued, breaking more windows and belongings with every booming step until she was finally out of sight.\nWith the giant gone the party didn’t take long to disperse. Friends and families grabbed their drunken fellows and returned home. Emil was no exception. He knew he would pass out on his bed immediately and once his eyes opened it would begin. The image of Andrei’s appreciative expression never left his head. It tore at the young man’s heart. He was such a good person, for this to happen to him was simply unfair. But tomorrow it would be over at long last; though that knowledge didn’t little to ease the young man’s sympathetic conscience.\n \n","Night came and went by in a flash. It felt as though barely a moment had passed before light forced itself upon Emil’s eyes. Why did he ever set his bed up beside a window anyway? Ah yes, to wake him up. Of course. An idea he cursed right about now.\nTempting as it was to stay in bed and sneak into the crowd only after he was well rested; Emil slipped from his bed and dressed himself, opting to skip breakfast and make way right for the town square.\nNaturally every member of the town was present. They all stood around the area in one singular mass surrounding Alexandra, who funnily didn’t seem the slightest bit weary or hung over, completely at odds with the rest of the town who seemed mostly dead on their feet.\nDamn, he was already late. Thankfully nobody seemed to pay him any mind as he snuck in and joined the thrall of people gazing upon the giant. It appeared as though Alexandra was delivering some idiom about the significance of the day and her gratitude towards Windermere for accepting her for all these years. Or at least something along those lines. He was only half paying attention to her words.\nAt the heart of the square she stood in all her giant beauty, hands on her hips as she peered down towards her Attendant before her feet. In spite of what was about to happen he stood proudly and met her mirthful gaze head on.\n“Today marks a year of your service Andrei.” Her blue eyes washed over him warmly. Her visage curled into a gentle smile while she knelt down on one knee before her faithful servant. “You have done well for me. One of the strongest Attendants I have ever had the privilege of having. It is no easy job to be mine but you answered the call better than most and for that I thank you. Truly you were a blessing from the Gods.” Her hand reached down, offering her open palm to Andrei. The man stepped on top of it without a moment’s hesitation.\n“I want you to know I bear you no ill will. This is simply how things are, and I’m not one to break tradition. But for you I shall make it quick.” Alexandra nodded dutifully and brought her hand up. Tension permeated the air, thick enough it threatened to suffocate. It was time. Nearby mothers covered their children’s eyes preemptively.\nIt began with Alexandra bringing her former Attendant up to her face. They appeared to exchange some quick dialogue with one another in low whispers. Then her lips pursed, delivering a gentle kiss to his smaller body. Jutted out just enough to be visible, her tongue sampled the young man’s body and savored his taste. After a few swift licks her large fingers grabbed his tunic from behind and ripped it off with enough force to knock the man on his back. Though nobody could see it Alexandra quickly did the same with his trousers.\n“It has been fun Andrei. Perhaps in one of the Seven Realms we can meet once again.” The blonde giant opened her mouth wide. All could see the woman’s tongue roll from within, saliva strands connecting it to the roof of her mouth and breaking with the faintest of her breaths. Her hand tilted back, allowing gravity to do the rest. Andrei could be seen sliding down, resigned to his fate. True to her word, Alexandra made it quick. The splintered sounds of bone crunching came immediately. All it took was a single bite and she swallowed, wiping her lips with the back of her wrist as a single trail of blood dripped down her cheek. Everyone watched with nary a sound of protest.\nBrutal and perhaps even unnecessary, this was easily the most peculiar of Windermere’s or rather Alexandra’s traditions. Put candidly, each year the old Attendants were sacrificed to make way for the new. Why? Nobody knew. Another facet long lost to history. Perhaps it was just in a giant’s nature to kill every so often. Maybe Alexandra tended to grow bored of her playthings and tries to have one last hurrah with them before moving on. Nobody could claim to know the workings of a giant’s reasoning. They just knew it was wiser to do as she commanded rather than protest.\nEmil recalled his first time bearing witness to this scene. At the crisp age of ten he had finally grown old enough to watch as the Attendant of the time met his end beneath Alexandra’s boot, then her first order for his replacement was to clean his predecessor off her sole. It was and had always remained a strange and eerie reminder of what she was. For all her comradery and gentleness she offered, Alexandra was a giant at heart. Nobody could explain the tradition when he asked. They all only offered the inquisitive young Emil the same vague answer.\nThat was simply how it was.\nThe scene before them served as a reminder that at any point Alexandra could end them on a whim. Perhaps that was in fact its purpose Emil mused.\nWith the public execution done Alexandra stared to the torn clothing between her fingers for a long moment, neither saying a word nor displaying a particular emotion. Quietly, her fingers opened the pouch at her hip and slid the rags inside. “Now…” Her voice thundered and drew everyone’s eye back to her visage. “To pick the new Attendant.” Despite what she had just done she wore a playful smirk.\nHer oceanic eyes scanned the crowds, stopping on a person every so often. She stepped towards everyone with a hand waggling its fingers. “Now what do I want I wonder? A strong Attendant for chores? A smart one for banter? Or perhaps a talented one for amusement?” Alexandra playfully slid a finger along the cobblestone roads along the edges crowd. It tapped teasingly at Erica the village songstress and moved along once she had gotten a surprised shriek from the girl.\nAoi the Brute. The cunning Aria. The wise but presumptuous Amair. The finger threatened to choose person after person, always moving on after gauging their reaction or playfully knocking them over. Despite the palpable tension in the air Alexandra was having fun at least. Even when a touch nervous Emil could at least admire that smile of hers.\nNever in a million eons could he have predicted the finger would gesture to him: the nobody who blended into the crowd. Emil felt himself pale before the massive digit. Any second now she’d chuckle and move on. Certainly. Yes. There was nothing to fret.\n“You.” Alexandra rumbled, her tone decidedly serious.\n…What?\nWho…?\nThere was no way…\n…Alexandra picked him…\nThis was a joke right? She was going to laugh any time now. No matter how often Emil told himself that her expression failed to budge an inch. The finger kept itself directly before him. This was impossible. Was he still dreaming? Alexandra would never pick him.\nBut she did.\n“I decided this long ago Emil.” Her loud voice answered the question painted upon the young man’s face. “You shall be my Attendant. Congratulations.”\nThere had to have been some sort of a mistake. Alexandra couldn’t have picked him. But she just said his name…Wait, how did she know his name? Did he do something to stand out in her eyes? If so what? Nothing came to mind.\nNothing except his exchange with Andrei the night prior.\nAll at once a wave of loud sounds made him jump from his stupor. It was a moment later that Emil realized what it was: applause. All around him the crowds of people were joyous, clapping and cheering at him like he was a hero. What sort of nonsense was this? He wasn’t being awarded some special prize. This was a death sentence!\n“Don’t look quite so terrified my dear Attendant. I don’t bite…much.” The giant giggled and rose to her feet. “I have preparations to make for the Pilgrimage. Get him ready as I do so.” She bellowed out the order nonchalantly to some figure in the crowd.\nEmil only vaguely understood he was now watching Alexandra walk away. Then moments later he realized that he too was being led somewhere.\nThis couldn’t be real, but already some small part of him had begun to slowly accept it. Or at the very least grasp it. It couldn’t be real and yet it was. No amount of denial could change that.\n \n He was the new Attendant.\n \n","“…and then you will return as an Attendant. Do you understand?”\nEmil was sitting across from the elderly man, his dopey and vacant expression making it painfully obvious that he hadn’t heard a word of what was said. The elder sighed and began tentatively stroking his magnificent beard. The silence went on for a full minute before Emil’s eyes widened with realization.\n“Ah- Yes, you’re right…” He nodded unconvincingly.\n“Would you like me to repeat it to be sure?” The elder offered politely.\nOnce again Emil nodded. “Yeah…Sorry to make you repeat it for the third time.”\nIt was actually the sixth time, but the old man let that particular fact slide. It was the least he could do after all. “Right, well as I said before. Your duty as you know is to attend to Lady Alexandra’s needs and desires. No request is off the table and you should steel yourself for any and everything. What you do reflects on Windermere as a whole. In a sense you are a representative. It is one of the highest honors she can give one of us.”\nFunny, to the supposed honored one it felt like anything but.\nIgnoring the skepticism emanating from Emil he proceeded. “Today will be spent preparing for your transition to your new life. All your ties to the village shall be severed and you shall depart with Lady Alexandra on the morrow. Typically this would be spent saying farewell to family members and spouses but ah…You have oft been unfortunate in that regard have you not? Tis a shame, but it does make things simpler.”\nIn other words he had no girlfriend and no living relatives so no problem right? Emil glared at the elderly man before him, repulsed by the hidden meaning in his words. “I have a lot of friends.” Came the stubborn rebuttal, sounding more childish than he had hoped.\n“And you will be sorely missed by them I am sure.” The elder shot back. “But the decision has been made lad. There is naught we can do but try to brace you for it. Do not hate me for the will of Lady Alexandra.”\nOf course he was right. Once Alexandra decided on something the matter was settled. No amount of pouting or protesting would change that. This was merely a courtesy, a formality for his sake. But that didn’t mean Emil had to like it. “So what then?” He clicked his tongue in dissatisfaction.\nThe elder cleared his throat, a surefire sign that he was going to ramble at length. “Once everything has been taken care of and goodbyes spoken, you and Lady Alexandra shall depart on a Pilgrimage. Just as the first Attendant Hue and all others before you. During this time she will personally instruct and train you in your duties until she feels you are competent and able. Then you both will return and all will proceed from there. All your days will be spent at Lady Alexandra’s side and Windermere shall forever be indebted to you. You shall leave as Emil the farmhand, but you shall return as Emil the Attendant. Do you understand?”\nThe Pilgrimage…Amidst all his scattered thoughts Emil had forgotten all about it. The small window of time in which he would be alone and away from the village with only Alexandra at his side. Neither he nor anyone else knew what actually happened during this journey. Only that once an Attendant returned from it they were different. It was a journey that turned the proud young Andrei into the subservient man he had been during his service. Emil shuddered just imagining what sort of a broken shell of a man he would return as.\n“And I leave on the morrow?”\n“Correct.”\n“Seven Hells…And here I was looking forward to asking a girl out during the Flower Festival.” The young man laughed dryly. The idea of asking a woman out now seemed oddly humorous.\nAcross from him the elder didn’t seem to particularly enjoy the joke. “Also…” He cleared his throat. “I doubt I need to say this but should you get any ideas of running from your duties…Don’t.” There was an edge to his weathered eyes that wasn’t there before. This was no mere warning. It was a threat. “Lady Alexandra will find you. And even if she does not, your actions could lead to catastrophe for the town. It is unlikely you could return, and even if you did-“\n“I understand.” Emil stated flatly. Fleeing had already long since crossed his mind and been ruled out so he didn’t need a reminder, especially not from some old codger.\nHe nodded, though not without arching an eyebrow at the moodiness of the typically submissive young man before him. “I see…Once you return then you will be an Attendant and as village custom dictates we cannot interfere with your duties.”\nThat was an outright lie but Emil didn’t have the energy to call him out. There was no rule regarding town treatment of an Attendant. It was merely an unspoken superstition passed down through the generations. But the fact this man had the audacity to speak it as though it were law was infuriating.\nIf nothing else the building rage allowed Emil to put aside his despair for a moment in favor of a new incorrigible thought. The idea that this session was going to last for quite a while longer.\n \n---------\n \nThis was it. After this they’d be leaving.\nEmil took one last look at the building he had called his home. It perhaps wasn’t the fanciest place but it certainly wasn’t bad, very middle of the road just like its occupant. Was this all really necessary? Of course it was far too late to begin wondering that.\nAlexandra stood before the building with a wide smile. Her beautiful blonde features and bright blue eyes were absolutely elated, like a child about to break into a new toy. “I always love this part!” She giggled excitedly.\nAll around the crowd watched on. Yesterday Emil would’ve been a part of that crowd, likely somewhere in the back, but now he had the “pleasure” of a front row seat. He looked up to the giantess eagerly popping her knuckles, then down to the home he had spent so much time living in.\nHe steeled himself as Alex grabbed the edges of his old roof, his small, callused hands clenching tight. This was his last tie to the town, and as the elder had told him all his ties had to be severed. Once this was gone that would be the end of it.\nThe building may have been made with stone but it crumbled almost immediately to the large fingers, allowing the digits to grip the roof and pull it off with seeming ease. Alexandra turned to the crowd and showed off the nearly undamaged top of the house. It remained in pristine condition all things considered, nary a shingle out of place. Alex grinned and flipped it over to show the interior as well, offering a clear visual before her palms crashed in on one another and ripped through the shingles in a single large tear. What was once essentially untouched had now become a few broken fragments that were carelessly tossed aside. Oohs and ahhs followed as the giant took a bow. Like it was just a show and not a giant destroying someone’s home.\nBit by bit the giant poked her fingers into the walls and ripped each and every stone, either casting it aside or crushing it to dust in her fist. In what felt like a couple short minutes the house was nearly completely torn apart and in its place was a pile of stone and bricks that once comprised it. Scattered among it all sat the few pieces of furnishings Emil had. Shelves, a simple bed, a carpet, pots, pans, farming tools, so on and so forth. The only evidence that this pile of debris and junk was anything but.\nSeeing it all like this was…strange. He was surprised by how little this horrific scene bothered him. It wasn’t that he didn’t grasp what was happening. The home he had lived and grown up in was being destroyed by a giddy giant. It was just…Emil had expected to be more saddened by what he was witnessing. But really what was he losing? A few poultry belongings.  Not much compared to what else had happened today. Not a big deal relative to his new sentence he supposed.\nAt least Alexandra seemed to be having fun with it. She playfully and thoroughly dismantled the home with her bare hands. Taking great care to savor and relish the feeling of wanton destruction she was so easily causing. Even once it was naught but debris and it seemed over she raised her leather boot over and began stomping with a very pleased smile. Each stomp shook the ground, breaking the bricks and wood into little bits. To the giant it was likely no different than stepping on twigs. With each lowering of her foot the debris pile shrank and shrank, compressed and crushed repeatedly until finally it was little more than a pile of splinters and dust. With the demolition finished a giant boot set foot over the miniscule pile and the blonde giant stood proudly to the impressed noises of the crowd.\nEmil’s last attachment to Windermere had been smashed underfoot. Sort of fitting in retrospect really.\nAlexandra turned her head and smiled down at the young man once the deed was done. There was no malice in her visage. If anything she seemed genuinely happy and without remorse, though perhaps in some ways that was worse. Her hand came down near him and opened expectactly. It was obvious that she wanted him to climb aboard, but instead of rushing into her grasp Emil remained skeptical about the open palm.\n“Come, we have much to do Emil.” She urged him on.\nOne last look. If nothing else he wanted last look around at all the faces who had watched the scene unfold. He made a note to remember their expressions. Nervous, unsure, optimistic, resigned, the last time these people would likely look at him directly and this was his parting gift. Not a single teary eye in the bunch. What a joke.\nEmil smiled wanly and turned his back to them, taking the first step on his new life.\nAlexandra easily lifted him up and set him atop her shoulder, and off they went. With a few ground-shaking steps the Pilgrimage was off.\n \n"," \n \n“You know…You’re awfully quiet.”\nAlexandra turned her head to the young villager sitting atop her shoulder. It had been roughly an hour since they had departed, yet the entire journey thus far had been spent in utter silence. Emil had simply seated himself, began staring ahead blankly, and had been deathly quiet since. Were it not for the occasional moment her braid brushed against his little body Alex could have been forgiven for forgetting he was there at all.\nAnd her comment did little to change that. Understandable given the circumstances she figured. It was a lot to take in after all. Still, to be silent for so long was a little unsettling to the giant. At least if he was screaming and begging to be released there’d be something to work with. Even if he was just a blubbering mess that would be at least a starting point. Alas, Emil wasn’t keen on giving her anything of the sort.\n“Come on~ We’re gonna be spending a lot of time together from now on you know. Being stubborn about it isn’t going to change anything.”\nEmil glanced over to her and quickly looked back away. Okay. At least he was apparently listening. That was something.\n“Fine, don’t talk. I can dialogue enough for the both of us.” Alexandra shrugged, never breaking her stride. “Despite what you may think I’m not some heartless monster or anything of the sort. All I ask is that you do what I say and we’ll get along just fine. But it doesn’t have to be so limited if you want. I may essentially own you, but we are also partners. If there’s something on your mind then speak. Trust me, you’ll be listening to me vent quite a bit.” She said in jest.\n“…Why me?”\nDid he just speak? It was such a low whisper even Emil wasn’t certain he had. Her large blue eyes widened and stared at him. “What was that? Speak up!” Alex asked, her voice laced with excitement.\n“…Why me?” Emil repeated his question at a louder tone, finally shifting his gaze to meet the giant’s blue irises.\n“Because I need an Attendant.” \nEmil rolled his eyes, finding the simplistic answer entirely unhelpful. What else could he expect from such a woman? “No. I mean why me?” His voice continued to raise itself, managing to regain some clarity. “There was an entire town of people. People who are far more suited to it then I am. So why choose me?”\nAlexandra stared carefully, her brow furrowing in deep thought. She seemed to genuinely ponder something for a moment. “Why do you ask? Did you not expect to be chosen?” She answered with a query of her own.\nIt was a response that tripped her new Attendant up. “Well ah…No. In fact, I did not.” His rebuttal stumbled out. The large face of the giant remained focused on him a mere few feet away. The possibility of her blowing him from her shoulder like a gnat in annoyance did indeed cross his mind. For such obvious reasons common sense said to shut up, but for whatever reason Emil continued. “I was neither the strongest…the smartest…the most attractive. Seven Hells I’m not even particularly talented or interesting.”\nAs he stuttered out line after line Alexandra chuckled, her voice silencing her Attendant with its low yet all the same overwhelming rumbles. “You are certainly quick to downplay yourself too.” She smiled sweetly at him. “But you are right. So why did I choose you? Do you have any ideas?” Behind them her blonde braid floated peacefully in the breeze.\n“No. None.” Emil answered immediately.\nWas it his imagination or did her smile shrink slightly? “I see…Well if you must know I had no reason.” Alexandra turned her attention back to their surroundings, carefully stepping over a small cluster of knee-high trees. “I merely teased the crowd until my finger happened to fall onto you. Then I just happened to choose you. Sorry if you wanted some grand reason from me. It was simply fate. A whim and nothing more.”\nEmil slumped. One hand gripped at the giant’s collar for support. “Ah, is that so?” He chuckled. “Just my luck I suppose then. Well…” His eyes lingered on Alexandra. Complicated feelings aside, it was a fair treat to be so close to the giant. Hers was a face he’d seen all of his life but something about the present circumstances made it feel new again. A faint aroma wafted into the young man’s nostrils, the scent of a woman…her scent. “Well, I’ll do my best.” Emil gulped as he said it. “This is all a lot to take in but…but I’ll do what I can.” Although it wasn’t like he had a choice in the matter anyway. It beat moping about it at least.\n“And I shall assist. That is the point of this pilgrimage after all.” Alexandra said as her ever radiant smile widened. “We are in the Outlands surrounding Windermere. Aside from game and the occasional bird we won’t be bothered. The perfect place for me to be teaching you what to expect and how to properly do your duties, and once you are ready we shall return and begin our new lives together.”\nThat didn’t quite sound like the servitude it actually was. If anything it sounded like… “I wasn’t aware being an Attendant was like getting married. Now I understand what all those men at the tavern groan about.” The jest escaped before the human even realized it.\nAlexandra grinned and wrapped her hand around her little Attendant, opening it once her palm was stretched in front of her. “Oh? An apt comparison my little Attendant. Our relationship is one where you shall care for me, spoil me, and guarantee my happiness while I keep a watchful eye on you and make sure you don’t go running off. Not unlike marriage at all.” Her grin widened as she saw Emil actually chuckle a bit at that. “There, much better.” Her finger rubbed at his thick brown hair playfully. “Smiling suits you much more than brooding.” The giant forefinger left his mussed hair, trailing downwards much to his horror.\n“H-Hey don’t do that I’m-“Emil attempted to push the large digit away but very quickly lost the will as roaring laughter overcame him.\n“You’re what?” The giant continued the relentless assault. “A plaything in my hands; that’s what.” She began to laugh alongside her self-proclaimed plaything, tickling Emil for several moments before finally pulling her finger back. “See? I’m not such a bad girl when you get to know me. Who knows? Maybe if you make me happy good things can happen.” One of the large eyes winked.\nEmil still wasn’t quite so sure. But if nothing else she cared enough to want to see him smile. That was something right? Maybe…Just maybe this wasn’t the worst thing ever. “Good things?”\nThen he found himself hovering over Alexandra’s open tunic, the cloth pulled back with her free hand and was offering a premier view of the supple valley down below. Alexandra grinned and dropped the young man inside without warning, closing the opening behind him. “Enjoy it in there! Once we make camp I’m giving you your first task!” She laughed and marched on, a faint blush on her cheeks.\nThough safely caught in Alexandra’s bosom, Emil feared his heart would stop with how feverishly it pounded against his chest. Never in all his years could he have ever envisioned this. He couldn’t even recall a time imagining it. Yet here he was, surrounded by the two round, perfectly crafted hills, each a few times his height. Light penetrated the tunic, illuminated by the faint veil of sweat the blonde had worked up and giving her already smooth skin a shimmering shine. Emil didn’t dare to move and risk doing something unsavory that could possibly anger Alexandra.\nWere it only so easy. Each step jostled the human from his stillness and assured he would collide against the mounds every time. There was no escaping the sensations violating his senses. The silken skin, the faint womanly scent, the heat, all of it appealed to the most base of all his human desires. Each breast tended to rustle against his linen attire, trying to entice him further with their overwhelming stature. It was all so blinding that it wasn’t until the dozenth step that Emil realized something: that Alexandra didn’t appear to believe in undergarments; and while he was struggling to restrain himself he could see that the giant was very clearly enjoying his struggles.\n“A-Alexandra let me out!” Emil yelped as another step forced his body against the upper side of a breast. His boot accidently kicked at an erect nipple and he did his best to scramble away from it, only managing to slide between the bosoms courtesy of Alexandra’s sweat.\n“Not a chance!” The giant boomed with laughter and skipped a few steps, sending her chest and Attendant into a bouncing frenzy the likes of which he could never hope to escape.\n \n----------\n \nAfter enduring that lewd torment for multiple hours, Emil praised the fresh air as Alexandra finally freed him from her bosom. The sky had long since darkened as the sun fell with the rise of the stars and naught but a small campfire (relative to Alexandra) illuminated the area. The flames rose higher than any building, running on the burning embers of a thick pile of uprooted trees. Emil was dazzled by the sheer size of it, or at least he would have been were it not for the words booming in his ears.\n“For the love of…All that time in there and you didn’t try anything? Not one grope? Sneak a little kiss? A quick lay?” Alexandra sighed in a voice filled with much disappointment. “I could’ve used the pleasure to uplift my spirits during the long march.” The giant shook her head as she set Emil onto the grassy plains before her.\nWas this giant serious? “Well excuse me for not knowing how to handle that!” Emil shouted indignantly. “Not exactly every day I find myself in a woman’s bosom!”\n“Might need to get used to it then. That’s one of the more tame areas.” She winked, sending the young man into an embarrassment induced silence. “Anyway, ready for your first task my dear Attendant?”\nEmil nervously straightened himself. “Yes…?” He watched as Alexandra reached down to her boots and began to slip them off, humming a low melody under her breath. Bare toes wiggled in the fresh air, one even popping to ease tension from a long day of marching. What his task was to be became increasingly apparent. As he expected, a moment later the giant shoved her bare feet into the ground before him. Her heel dug a nook in the soft Earth and propped itself up, toes wiggling in eager anticipation. Alexandra leaned back on her palms with a particularly smug look on her visage. Her eyes were filled with mischief.\n“Well? Don’t keep me waiting~” \n \n","It was Erik Ainsbarn, the 67th Attendant, who infamously quipped that massaging Alexandra’s feet was the same as working the fields of a dozen farms within the hour. Unfortunately for Emil, he quickly found that the historically infamous quote might have been an understatement. The job he had been tasked with was already proving to be more strenuous than he had ever imagined possible. Less than ten minutes at it and yet his arms ceaselessly screamed for reprieve. His heart threatened to escape his chest and his breath grew short as he weakly massaged with all the strength his sore limbs could muster.\nFor how well kept and easy going Alexandra appeared her feet sure didn’t quite live up the flawless image she perpetuated; calloused, moist to the touch, and even a bit smelly. They were the feet of a woman who was…well…constantly on her feet. It was clear they oft didn’t leave their boots. Countless years of journeying had left the soles tense enough that Emil mused that it would probably be easier to massage the boots instead. Emil pressed his hands into her foot as hard as he could, palms sinking into her firm flesh ever so slightly as he worked to ease her stress.\n “My Attendant isn’t getting tired already is he? You still have an entire other foot to work on after this you know.” Alexandra chuckled at his struggles, seemingly finding all his efforts amusing.\n“I fear I never bothered learning how to give a proper massage. Let alone to someone of your size.” Emil heaved, leaning against the foot. It didn’t matter that her scent wafted into his nostrils. He needed the breather.\n“It’s not my fault you spent more time in the fields than with the ladies.” She remarked with another giggle to follow. “Are you unable to give a poor, simple little girl like me a massage?”\nHe responded by hitting his fist against her arch. “There’s nothing poor, simple, or little about you.” Emil retorted in an annoyed tone.\nAlexandra’s foot pushed the human back and lowered her toes near him, the big one wagging playfully in his face. “Quite the contrary. You’ll never find someone as simple to understand as me. Though I will grant you that perhaps I am not the littlest woman in the land.” She laughed and patted the top of her Attendant’s head with the sweaty digit.\nEmil grimaced at the chastising toe, not even bothering to look up past it. “So you can’t blame me for not being able to offer a decent massage when your feet are several times my size.”\n“Not true. I could very easily blame you. After all, I have just shy of 200 other Attendants to compare you to. Right now you’re near the bottom of the list.” The giant grinned and rested her foot on its side. “Cute as it is to see you try to reach as high as you can it’ll be much easier if I do this. No?”\nEmil reddened slightly as he began pressing himself against Alexandra’s foot once again, trying his damnedest to work his hands into the thick layer of tension in her sole. The dirt beneath his shoes slowly gave way and slid behind him, kicking into the crackling fire. At last Alexandra let out a pleasured sigh. “Now you’re getting it.”\nThe young Attendant didn’t respond; too busy giving the massage his all. How strange that over the course of the day he began in the deepest pits of despair and ended up where he was now: Giving his all to make Alexandra happy. Though he did his best not to think too hard on it. It was just in his nature to do a job to the best of his abilities. If he had time to reflect on his choices he could instead use that extra brain power to push harder.\nAlexandra watched on happily while he worked, letting out the occasional happy grunt or hum. “Perhaps I was not wrong in choosing you after all.” Her eyes fluttered shut as she exhaled a deep breath.\nIf nothing else Emil could take pride in doing his first job well at least. He repositioned his hands and feet and readied for more. Unfortunately, a combination of mud under his feet and sweat on Alexandra’s caused him to slip and fall spectacularly on the ground not even a moment later.\n“Ow…” He rubbed his head to the chorus of roaring laughter from the giant, rising back up after a second.\n“It would seem that maybe I spoke too soon.” She applauded his slapstick and giggled. “No matter, that will suffice Attendant. Though need I remind you…” As one foot pulled back the other swung overhead and hovered it’s giant self over Emil. “…That you have another?” Alexandra’s face didn’t seem quite wide enough for the grin she was sporting. Several flakes of fist-sized dirt rained from her foot onto the pitiful human.\nStaring up at Alexandra’s admittedly pretty foot all, Emil could see was the next couple hours of his life. They did not look fun. “Can’t I at least get a break?” He groaned.\nAlexandra quirked her lips in thought for a moment then smiled and nodded. “I think that’s fair. But in return I would like a kiss.”\nEmil’s eyes had never been so wide. Was this woman serious? Was this a thing Attendants got to do? He looked up to the giant’s face, and her soft, delicate lips. “W-Well if that is what you want…” The human dismissively accepted with a shrug, trying his best to sound disinterested.\n“Excellent!” Alexandra clapped her hands happily and brought the upraised foot down nearby. “You may begin when ready.” Her sole ground into the dirt expectantly.\nHe took one look at the toes that were eagerly tapping along the ground a few feet away. “…Oh.”\nThe blonde laughed uproariously at the blank stare her toes received. “You’d be amazed how many Attendants fall fo r this, too late to retreat now. That is, unless you wish to break your word…”\nSomehow Emil got the feeling that that would be a very bad idea. Still, did he have to? Alexandra’s feet were nice and all he supposed but they were tense, sweaty, and the smell seemed at its worst by her toes. He had to press his lips against that? Was this some kind of bizarre jest from the giant?\n“I’m waiting~” The giant teased in a singsong voice.\nAfter briefly weighing his options Emil sighed and stepped closer. Up close a few markings that he hadn’t noticed before were suddenly apparent. They appeared to be scars, marks that decorated her toes in plentiful amounts, particularly her big toe. “Where did all these scars come from?” The Attendant couldn’t help but ask.\n“Spears, swords, anything pointy really.” Alexandra shrugged. “They usually snap against my boots but every so often one breaks through.”\n“I see.” He nodded. Spears. Gifts from people who tried to hurt Alexandra, people who died. A subtle reminder of who he was dealing with. It was easy to forget that this woman had lived several lifetimes before ever even visiting Windermere. How many towns and people met their ends under these very toes Emil wondered. With his face right up next to them he couldn’t help but marvel. Each toe was nearly as long as he was tall and were as wide as two men.\n“Don’t worry. They don’t bite.” The giant chuckled.\n“No, but you might.”\n“Then I suppose you’d better hurry.”\nSwallowing his pride, Emil leaned forward that extra few inches and pressed his lips to the nearest appendage. It was a little degrading certainly, but the act came surprisingly natural to him. The sensation was no different than kissing a girl’s cheek or hand. He was actually rather surprised as he stepped back. It somehow wasn’t the awfulness he anticipated.\nAlexandra nodded in approval. “Break it is then. Take a moment for yourself. I’ll see if I can’t find something for dinner in the mean while.” After standing up the blonde giant offered her human companion a small wave before departing into the darkness.\nEmil gaped at her. Was that woman truly leaving him alone? What if he ran away? Not that he had anywhere to go. Windermere was countless miles away and there were no landmarks of any sort. Plus even if he made it the town knew full well he wasn’t supposed to be there. On second thought, maybe leaving him alone wasn’t so crazy after all. He sighed and fell onto his back, opting to lose himself in the starry sky.\nEverything had changed so quickly, literally overnight. By all accounts he should’ve been a pile of tears and pity begging to go home, but he wasn’t. It was almost a little troubling how quickly Emil had adapted to his circumstances. Granted, it wasn’t like he had a choice. Still, he was already smiling every so often, engaging in playful banter, humoring his giant master. Perhaps…he enjoyed being in Alexandra’s company?\n“Nah.” The human laughed the notion off immediately. It was more likely he was in shock. Or perhaps being near a woman for the first time in a year or two was why he was so at ease.\n“Damn.” Emil clicked his tongue as realization set in: Alexandra had left without her boots. Her foot was going to be filthy when she returned, and he’d probably have to clean it. Just another day as an Attendant he supposed.\nStill, for all the stories of how poorly the woman treated her Attendants Alexandra surprised him. She was so…nice, almost scarily so. The Alexandra who laughed and played with children was no different than the one he had spent the day with. In a way it was refreshing that she hadn’t made some abrupt change. In another it made him paranoid something was already amiss. Maybe that would be different with time, but for a first day it could’ve been worse. It was only how all this Attendant business would ultimately end that bugged him. Impending death sort of had a way of weighing in on one’s mind.\nHow would Alex do him in? A stomp? Eat him like Andrei? Crush him in her hands? Dry irony suggested maybe the toe that Emil kissed would smother him.\n“Back~”\nBooming footsteps and the loud voice announcing her return brought Emil back to reality. “Any luck?” He asked, seeing for himself that the question was moot a moment later.\nAlexandra was carrying over a dozen trees, actual, fully grown trees uprooted from the ground. Skewered through one of them were a series of oxen, freshly killed and gutted. “Sorry it took so long but I figured that we could use some firewood too while I was at it.” The giant smiled sheepishly and tossed a few of the trees into the massive fire. After stabbing two more trees into the ground around the embers and setting the skewer up to cook she leaned back and sighed. A simple meal over a campfire, just all done at Alexandra’s size; it was a sight to behold.\n“And now I believe that we have some unfinished business Attendant.” Alexandra smirked, already bringing a dirty barefoot back towards Emil. “Ready?” Her immaculate sole was caked in filth.\nIf he had to answer honestly…No. Especially not with how dirty it now was. Emil’s arms ached and screamed at the mere idea of having to massage another foot. And to do so on an empty stomach was just cruel. His thoughts must have been written across his face since Alexandra frowned almost immediately.\n“Fine.” She sighed. “I’ll be nice just for tonight. But tomorrow you’re doing both. I can’t get a good night’s sleep unless I get my daily massage.” She leaned back and smirked to herself. Meanwhile in a fit of exhausted relief Emil collapsed.\n \nThus, Emil's first day as Alexandra's Attendant drew to a close.\n"," \n“Okay! So for today we’ll be focusing on giving you some practice tasks.”\nThus was how Alexandra had explained the plans for the day over their breakfast. Emil nodded in response, recalling previous Attendants he had seen and the many little odd jobs they found themselves doing. If that was all today was to be then it wouldn’t be nearly as trying as say…massaging a giant foot. His arms were still sore after that particular ordeal.\n“Step back.” The giant ordered her Attendant with a quick gesture to the dimming campfire flames. Once he was safely out of harm’s way her boot came crashing into the wagon-sized embers, heel twisting to snuff them out underfoot. “So you can listen when you want to. That’s good.” She smirked. “Ready?”\nOf course he was. It wasn’t as though he had much of a choice in the matter after all. “Yes…Lady Alexandra.”\nSomething in the young man’s words made her pause, a quizzical look on her lovely visage. “Huh? Lady? Why the formality?”\nThe callout brought a flush to Emil’s face. “Well…I’m your Attendant so…I have to be formal right? Isn’t that how this works?”\nSilence. Then…\n“Fool.” Alexandra shook her head with a derisive smile on her fair face. “You misunderstand our relationship.” Now it was Emil’s turn to stare blankly at Alexandra; a dopey expression the giant likely found rather fitting for him. “You may service me. You may even answer to me, but that doesn’t make me any sort of nobility or person worthy of formality. I’m a simple girl. Not some posh Lady in a castle. Alex is fine.”\n“Okay um…Alex.” Emil nodded.\nShe smiled. “Much better Emil. Now onto business…” The giant reached into the pouch at her hip and pulled a large barrel from it, setting it down beside the Attendant. Her fingers tapped the top of it a couple times before she stepped back and casually sat on the grassy plains nearby. “I’m thirsty and could really use a drink.” Alexandra said as she got comfortable. “Be a good little Attendant and take care of that will you?”\nEmil turned a skeptical eye onto the barrel. Then another to the giant a dozen yards away. Perhaps someone like Andrei could carry a barrel filled to the brim with ale, but him? He’d have better luck bringing Alex her boots in the morning. In spite of that realization, he gripped the barrel from the bottom. With all of his strength welling up within his body and everything he had in him…the barrel moved precisely one inch off the ground before having to be set back down a moment later.\n“Too heavy?” Asked the smirking member of the peanut gallery as she tapped her fingers eagerly on her knees.\n“Of course not. It’s only half my size and filled to the brim with over a dozen gallons of ale.” The Attendant retorted in a flippant attempt to salvage some pride. Again, he tried to lift it to much the same result. Emil began to feel a newborn respect for Andrei and the fact that he could do this so effortlessly. Oh what he would give to have the former Attendant helping him at this moment.\nThe giant groaned and flopped onto her back. “I’m dying of thirst!” She pouted and turned her head on its side to watch, blonde hair splaying across the dirt in an ankle-high jungle. “So it’s too heavy for my poor little Attendant. What now I wonder?” Her eyes watched on, curious.\nSince brute force very clearly wasn’t working Emil decided to just try and roll the barrel over. Gripping the sides of it he pushed, watching happily as it quickly fell over and promptly shattered. “Ah…” His expression made it clear he did not expect that to happen. Kind of obvious in hindsight really.\n“You broke it.” Alexandra sighed as her fingers dug into her pouch again. “Not a bad idea, but many of these barrels are several years old. Surprisingly fragile things; you’ve got to be more careful Emil. But, I suppose this is why we practice isn’t it?” Her fingers pulled another barrel from her side and set it down closer to her, tapping it to draw attention to it.\nAfter hurrying along and slowly turning the barrel on its side Emil managed to finally bring it up to the giantess’s face. Alex nodded before opening her mouth as wide as it would go. Just to make sure it couldn’t possibly be misinterpreted she pointed to it for good measure.\nEmil grimaced. The memories of Andrei and other Attendants of days of old who were eaten by Alexandra remained fresh in his memory. Were he to get too close the shimmering white teeth could easily behead him or worse. A grotesque vision of himself being chewed into paste and swallowed came to mind. The visceral image of his bloody self made him shudder. He pushed such thoughts to the back of his mind and rolled the barrel towards the awaiting chasm all the same, albeit he did so rather cautiously.\nWith every step he drew closer and felt the faint warmth of Alexandra’s breath wash over him. A couple strands of saliva stretched and broke apart as the great pink beast that was her tongue rolled out to accept the humble offering. Once the barrel was directly before the giant’s mouth her fingers plucked Emil by the shirt and set him aside, freeing the space so that she could wrap her lips around the barrel and sit back upright. Alexandra winked as she pushed the barrel in and chomped her mouth shut, swallowing whatever was inside. “Delicious.” She licked her lips. “A bit of room for improvement, but not bad at all.”\n“I live to please.” He shrugged.\n“Ready for your next task then?” Alexandra said whilst rubbing her wrist against her lips.\nOf course there was more. Why did he think there wasn’t? “Of course.” It was something to get used to he supposed.\nThen Alexandra stood up. Yet another thing he was going to have to get used to it seemed. Seeing this woman bigger than any of the buildings he had ever seen stand up never failed to take his breath away. As he craned his neck to look up the blonde shook her head and pointed down. “This one isn’t hard. Well, perhaps not in the traditional way.” Her finger directed his gaze to her boots. A simple brown leather pair, but if the stories were to be believed they were hundreds of years old themselves. “Just clean off my boots. That’s all.”\nClean would imply a rag and some water or perhaps a scrubbing brush, but they both knew that wasn’t what she was asking for. “Do I have to?” Emil was unable to hide the distaste in his tone.\n“No complaining. You kissed my foot yesterday. This should be nothing.” Alex stubbornly crossed her arms and tapped her foot dangerously close to her Attendant. “I’m waiting.”\nWell it was worth a shot. The giant did have a point though. He was already ankle deep in the hole; a few more inches wouldn’t hurt. He opted to make it quick and hurriedly ran his tongue along the leather. Emil didn’t know what to expect once he finally did it. Mocking laughter? A taste so foul it would never leave his mouth? Instead it was just…nothing, flavorless with the occasional bit of grime. A little leathery, but nothing too bad. Far from the worst thing the man had ever tasted.\nWhile her Attendant serviced away at her boots Alexandra cleared her throat. “Good. It usually takes longer for an Attendant to be able to do this. There may be hope for you yet.” Her cheeks flushed as she watched Emil work. “That’s enough. I just wanted to prove a point.”\nHe sure didn’t need to be told twice. Emil stepped back the moment he could, running his tongue along his mouth to get rid of the odd taste. “Prove a point?”\nThe giant sighed. “Truth be told I couldn’t care less if you use your tongue or a rag or what have you. But for appearances sake once I make an order it must be carried out immediately. Your mouth is the most readily available cleaning tool you have, but you must be willing to use it.”\n“Appearances? Why would that matter when you’re…”\n“The size of a couple castles? It’s a long story.” Alex said dismissively. “Now get yourself some water. You have a five minute break before you’ll need to ready yourself for the next task. We still have much left to do.”\nHe gave the giant an odd look, but ultimately left as she commanded.\n \n-----------\n \nHours later Emil was laid out on the ground, panting and completely covered in sweat. The sun had come and gone, leaving the duo to sit beside the giant crisping campfire once again.\n“Okay, maybe that was a bit much for the first day.” His giant companion scratched her cheek sheepishly. “But you did good to bare yourself through it all.  Thank you.” Alexandra smiled down at him, and for a moment it almost seemed like all the day’s efforts were worth it just for that.\n“I just want to wash myself off and rest.” He pouted. Well…almost worth it.\nAlexandra giggled. “Fair enough. Get some rest Emil.”\nOnce more the human found himself turning a surprised eye to the woman. Their relation was essentially that of a master and slave. Yet these moments kept cropping up. Moments where she kept showing such consideration for him. If this was what his next year was going to be like. Then perhaps this whole Attendant thing wasn’t turning out precisely as horrific as the stories lead him to believe.\n“Can I help you?”\nEmil blinked. “Huh?”\n“You’ve been staring at me for over a minute now.” The blonde smirked. “Were you so enraptured by my illustrious beauty in the campfire that you found yourself stunned?”\n“No.”\n“You’re no fun.” Alex puffed her cheeks. “So what’s on your mind?” The giant reached back into a pile of massive trees, each no bigger than a stick to her, and lazily tossed one into the fire. It landed with a fierce thud and kicked up a thick cloud dust before starting to burn.\nHe looked away awkwardly. “Nothing really.”\n“But…?” She asked with a leading grin on her lips.\nEmil let out a dejected sigh. “Well, you’re not what I expected.”\n“Oh?” The human could feel Alexandra’s blue gaze upon him. Giving him that surprised look she oft did whenever he was foolish enough to speak honestly. “And what did you expect?”\nHe was treading on thin ice it felt like. A single bad word and Alexandra could easily inflict any number of torments on his person. “I dunno, but not this.” Even so the truth came out.\nAlex smirked and leaned back on her palms. “Perhaps you’ve listened to those gossipers in the tavern? The ones that say that I make my Attendants live in my boots, forever licking the filth from my feet. Or maybe the lot that say I make you perform tricks to entertain me while I dangle you over my mouth. They weave so many stories. Quite creative really. Granted, there was one Attendant about a hundred years back. He adored it when I was rough with him, often begged me to degrade him at every chance. A real special lad that one.” Her legs stretched out as she laughed, each foot causing a tremor as they smashed into either side of the fire. “Sorry to disappoint you Emil.” She paused. “It never crossed your mind that maybe I acted like any other person. Did it?”\nThe giant’s knack for observation was spot on as always. Emil couldn’t deny that. “No, I suppose not.” He didn’t even know what he thought. When it was all laid out before him the notion that Alexandra was some sort of monster to her Attendants seemed almost silly. A tease sure, but definitely not a cruel woman. He almost felt bad for even considering it. “Saying that you act like everyone else is a bit of a stretch though.”\n“Maybe.” She admitted. “Or maybe just not that many people get to know me.” The blonde stated matter of factly.  “Just that lucky one person I choose every year. Everyone else avoids me if they can.”\nThere was something a bit defeated in that tone she used. Clear enough that even someone as unremarkable as Emil picked up on it. “That’s not true at all. The children play with you all the time. I always see you hanging around them.”\n“And when they get older?” The giant replied with a shrug.\n“They…stop…” Okay, perhaps that wasn’t his best idea to comfort the giant. What else was there? “Well…” Why was he even doing this? Somewhere within the dopey Attendant was that nagging inability to let something go. It really irked him in times like these. No matter what his better judgement said his mouth ran its course. “Well even so, who needs ‘em? Just look at yourself!”\nHe was met with a blank stare.\n“Beautiful. Strong. You know everyone considers you the prettiest in the village in spite of themselves.” The words simply would not stop. With a few short sentences Emil had begun rattling off praises to the blonde giant. “Despite being well…you know, you’re really well kept. You smell nice. You’ve got lots of things going on!”\n“Oh do go on.” Alexandra began to grin. “Sweet talk like that will get you anywhere with me.” An azure eye winked. “I’ve never been serenaded by a human before.” She teased. “Is my little Emil trying to earn himself a little reward from his mistress?”\nEmil could feel all the blood rushing to his face. “I’m tired.” He rolled on his side, facing away from the blonde. His pride as a man wouldn’t allow him to continue entertaining the giant or this conversation any further.\n“Very well then. Goodnight my romantic little Attendant. We’ve got a special day tomorrow.” Alex’s giggles would haunt his dreams tonight. Of that there was no doubt.\n \n"," \nAs it would turn out, “Special Day” meant another day of exactly the same chores and tasks as the previous days with none of the breaks. Unsurprising as it was, it still somehow shocked Emil to realize that. but hours upon hours of tending to Alexandra’s every whim. Needless to say the Attendant’s body was nothing but aches and pains once the day finally drew to a close.\n“Was it really necessary for me to massage your feet and your back?” Emil groaned.\nAlexandra, naturally, didn’t share any of the exhaustion of her Attendant. Quite the opposite actually if her glowing expression was any indication. “Of course. You had to make up for not being able to finish that massage a few nights ago.” She was busy setting the foundation for their nightly campfires, only occasionally glancing at the human collapsed on the ground beside her.\n“And the couple hours of delivering barrels of ale?”\n“I was thirsty.” Alex shrugged.\n“And when you asked me to tie your boots because, and I quote, ‘I can’t be bothered’?”\n“I was bored.” She smirked and stood up. “If you have a problem with that the bottom of my boot is taking complaints.”\n“I’ll pass.”\nAlexandra laughed. “Believe it or not you’re already showing signs of improving. A few more days and we may even be ready to start heading back to Windermere.”\nEmil rolled his eyes. “Great.” The weariness made him a bit snappier than usual. Alexandra wasn’t wrong though. Something about the errands today felt less strenuous for some reason. Maybe he actually was improving. Not that he’d ever admit the blonde giant was right. Gods forbid.\n“If it’s any consolation tomorrow should be much more relaxing. I just wanted to get as much out of today as I could.” Alexandra took a couple booming steps towards her Attendant. On either side of him her boots fell, each almost as large as a house. The giant loomed directly overhead and gazed down playfully. “You did good today. Go ahead and take it easy while I get some firewood. Okay?”\n“Can do Alex.” He lazily replied.\nThe lovely view of the giant was blocked as one of her feet moved, the dirty sole hovering over her Attendant. “Kiss for good luck?” Specks of fist-sized dirt rained down on him.\n“Sure.” Emil was much too tired to care and just obliged, puckering his lips against the bottom of the boot. It was nothing new at this point.\n“You’re learning.” Alex laughed and pulled her foot back. “I should be back soon. Try not to run off while I’m away.”\n“Couldn’t if I wanted to.”\n“So you don’t want to leave.” Alexandra smirked and began to walk off. Emil lazily waved, not bothering to see her off. Step by step the footsteps grew softer, turning from booms to soft thuds in the distance. Soon they couldn’t even be heard at all. By that point Emil had already slipped into the deep thralls of sleep.\n \n \nAt some point his eyes reopened again. Or maybe they were always open. The familiar buildings of Windermere surrounded him. He was a kid again. There was nothing strange about that, he just was. All around were the other boys, each in the same predicament he was. Shoved out the door by a nagging mother who demanded they take part in the Flower Festival.\n“But I don’t wanna give no girl a flower! I dun’ care how pretty there are!” A dozen meters away Andrei complained to his mother. The sight made the boy smile, and sad for some reason.\nA blur. The world around him shifted. Now he was in a small clearing. He knew he’d seen them around here before but…Ah-ha. There they were. The flowers, nice and hidden away where none of the other boys would think to look. Before he realized it he had scooped ‘em all up. Some lady nearby said some were weeds, but he made sure to correct her.\n“This should make Momma happy!” He beamed. For some reason the thought of his mother was sad too. Regardless, he began to hurry. The ground shook in rhythmic patterns. The giant was nearby. His Momma didn’t like it when he and his friends hung around her. They called her big words like dangerous or menacing. But she was super nice, and close by how it sounded. Each step was growing louder, and louder, and louder…\n \n \nBOOM!\n \n \n“Ugh…” Emil’s eyes fluttered open. Just a dream. “Welcome back Alex.” How much time had passed? At least enough for the sun to set and for the sky to grow starry; a few hours? He sheepishly sat back up and began to rub the sleep from his eyes. How long had it been since he’d had a dream? And it was some nonsense about giving a flower to his mother. Figures, just the silly sort of thing he would come up with. “Even in my dreams I can’t escape those loud stomps of yours.” The young man laughed, finally opening his eyes.\nIt wasn’t Alex.\nIn fact, he wasn’t sure what it was. Everything was still dark and all that remained visible was a pair of dark, beady eyes staring at him from the pitch black abyss. As his vision began to clear he started to see more. Two…Three…Four…Seven sets of eyes. Their features began to register, hazy but growing increasingly clear. Gray fur, whiskers, long snouts, and the bared fangs. They faced Emil in formation, poised to pounce at a moment’s notice.\nWolves.\nEmil’s blood turned to ice. The beasts were ten meters away, more than capable of easily closing that gap in seconds. He knew it, and so did they. He had no means of defending himself. They had him outnumbered. The second they pounced that would be it.\nEverything was silent. Even the wind came to a halt. All Emil could hear was his own deafening heartbeat. What should he do? What could he do? Even if logic said he was dead his instincts just couldn’t come to terms with such an answer. Careful not to alert his hunters, his eyes turned to the set up for the campfire Alexandra had prepared. To her it was little more than rocks and sticks, but to anyone who wasn’t a giant it was towering bundle of boulders and trees. If he could somehow get on top of them, maybe, just maybe he could wait the wolves out.\nThere was one tree in view with just the right series of branches. If he could climb fast enough he could reach the top. It was only a few meters away.\nCrack\nThe Alpha at the head of the pack took the first move, its paw smashing a twig beneath it.\nEmil remained dead still. All the pain in his body was numbed. His remaining strength welled within his legs.\nCrack\nAnother step, the Alpha’s pack began to follow his lead.\nWhat Emil would have given for Alexandra’s thundering footsteps right about now.\nCRACK\nThe Alpha took yet another step, eyes never leaving his prey. It was almost as if he knew it was coming, and was anticipating it. The pressure was suffocating.\nThat was it; Emil broke off as fast as he could in a full sprint. He didn’t need to look to know the wolves had done the same. Their snarls and growls were all that filled his ears. Fangs snapped mere inches away from him, only missing because of how eagerly competitive the pack was over this helpless morsel.\nWith a panicked crash into the base of the tree Emil reached his target. Without pausing for reprieve he clambered upwards as fast as he could. In any other circumstance this climb would have been exhausting, but at this moment his body may as well have been air. He was virtually weightless as he glided up the branches. Down below the wolves were snapping upwards at him. A few branches up and he was already well out of their range.\nEmil paused, just for a moment. The young man’s breaths were ragged, uneven. The shrill sounds of jaws snapping at him blotted out all other sound. This spot was safe, even so the desperation that flooded him urged him to keep going, unable to even bringing himself to look back and check on how far up he had gone. That was his mistake.\nCR-ACK!\nAfter reaching upwards once more the branch in his hands snapped, the last line of support in his moment of need and it had abandoned him. The Attendant let out a shriek as he stumbled backwards, his back landing on another branch far below. Snapping teeth rang in his ears. He must’ve been mere inches away from their jaws. Being this close to the beasts, all it would take was one good jump and that’d be it.\n“So this is it.” Emil let out one last dry laugh. “Couldn’t even make it a week.” The joke allowed him to brace himself for what was to come. Emil’s eyes shut in acceptance. Hopefully it would be quick.\n \n \n“YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE!”\n \nOverpowering all other sound was a voice like thunder. The wolves whimpered in fear, but to Emil the voice brought him back to reality.\nRight as he managed to turn his head he saw the familiar boot stomp into the ground, instantly crushing three of the wolves to a bloody pulp. The remaining four looked at the foot in horror. In that brief moment a giant fist smashed into another one. Its blood tarnished the otherwise fair skin of the giant’s hand.\nThose few short movements were all the pack needed to see to flee. Just like that the hunters had become the hunted. They were less than half their number, but their giant predator still wasn’t satiated. As they ran she gave chase. The giant’s hand grabbed one of the discarded trees within the fireplace and hurried. Fast as the animals may have been they were no match for her speed. Emil could only watch in awe. Each second the wolves would run a dozen steps over and she would match it in one. In mere moments another wolf met the bottom of her boot.\nOnly the Alpha and one other remained, and that other was smashed into gore by the large tree the giant wielded like a stick. It was a spectacular sight. In a matter of moments, the blonde giant had crushed almost half a dozen wolves underfoot and smashed another with an uprooted tree. All these beasts that had so easily cornered Emil, and yet they were mere insects before her rampage. The Alpha of the pack ran with all the speed of a great hunter but it meant nothing. Before the Alpha could get any further a set of large fingers grabbed him. He struggled and bit for all he could but it amounted to little more than scratches against the thick pads of the giant’s fingers. In his final moments he locked eyes with his executioner. Her oceanic irises bore down without mercy. Seeing his death reflected in that intense gaze, the creature lowered its head and accepted its fate.\nIt took but a second before Alexandra clenched her fist and crushed the final wolf in her fist. The creature perished with a sickening crack of his own as blood shot out and dripped along the giant’s fingers. There was none of the usual joy or playfulness to her expression. Just the hardened exterior of a predator. When all was said and done the massacre had barely lasted fifteen seconds. She turned to her Attendant. The bottom of her boots, her hand, even the tree she held were all stained and dripping with blood. The eyes that were without mercy moments ago looked in naked concern at Emil. “Emil! Are you okay?”\nHe was stunned, truly, unequivocally, undeniably stunned. “Y-Yeah.”\n“Thank the Gods.” Alexandra fell to the ground and released a long withheld breath. The tree she levied crashed into the dirt with a resounding crash. “I’m so sorry Emil. I didn’t notice the tracks, and once I did…”\n“It’s okay.” He could feel his senses start to die down with the threat removed. “Let’s just…Try to move on. Shall we?”\nThe giant nodded. “I’ll get the fire started and keep watch for the night. Try and get some rest Emil. We’ll take it easy tomorrow. I promise.”\nThe relief in her voice was palpable. How concerned was she when she found out he wondered? Did she fret that much over him? “Um…Thank you Alex.” There wasn’t much else to say. The giant woman had saved his life.\nAlex dismissed it with a wave of her hand. “Don’t. This was my fault to begin with.”\n“I didn’t notice the tracks either you know. Besides, you saved me.” Why he chose now of all times to get stubborn he would never understand. “So thank you.”\nAlexandra stared blankly at him. “You’re welcome.” Her hand tapped the ground beside her. “Come on; sleep where I can watch you.”\nAfter all this, Emil was more than happy to oblige. The whole affair was enough excitement for a life time. With it passed he felt…drained. Nothing looked cozier than the ground beside the giant. He took up a spot beside her resting hand and laid down, eyes swiftly closing.\n“Goodnight Emil.” Alexandra’s voice was still shaken, but seemed to be slowly calming down.\n“Night Alex.”\nWith the danger now gone and Alexandra there once again he was free to return to the land of dreams. \n \n"," “And here we are! I knew it was around here somewhere.”\nFrom atop Alexandra’s shoulder, Emil leaned forward and gaped. Before the pair sat the largest expanse of water he had ever seen, a lake several miles wide that put the pitiful rivers in Windermere to shame. Its waters glistened gloriously in the sunlight. “I’ve never seen so much water…It’s beautiful.”\nAlexandra smirked at her Attendant’s blatant awe. “You should see the ocean some time then. This isn’t even a puddle compared to that.”\n“The ocean…? Isn’t that the river that you said goes on as far as the eye can see?” Emil asked with clear skepticism in his tone. Every so often Alexandra would reference these outlandish things to the point he had to wonder how much of it was real or make believe. What sort of purpose could such a huge amount of water have? Surely it was nonsense.\n“The very same.” Alex nodded and set Emil back down on the ground. The giant slipped her feet from her boots and began taking grand steps towards the lake. From beside the footwear Emil watched her thick soles sink into the muddy shore as cool water drifted in and out from between her toes. The gentle tickling of the waves brought a serene smile to her face. “Perhaps one day I will show you, if we’re ever away from this little hidden corner of the world.”\nShe was almost assuredly teasing but Emil still felt a ping of surprise. “I…think I would like that.” He responded without thought. He watched on as the giant relaxed in the distance. Then her hands reached for the bottom of her tunic and…was taking it off?!\n“W-W-Wait Alex what’re you doing?!” The young man flushed bright red as he smacked a hand over his eyes, unable to help but open a slit to peer through.\nAlexandra turned back cluelessly with her top half off. “I’m about to take a bath.”  She said plainly.\nOh right. That was the reason they had come here in the first place. Emil had completely forgotten. Having a near death encounter sort of did that to a person. Ever since dawn had risen neither of them said a word on the subject. Alex just declared from nowhere that they needed a bath after all the hectic drama and that was as far as their morning conversation went. Probably for the best all things considered.\nAll that didn’t matter right now though. What mattered was the half-naked giant in front of him. “With me right here?”\n“Of course not.”\n“Whew, for a moment there I almost thought-“\n“You’re coming in with me.”\n “I am?”\n“You are.” Alexandra stated flatly as she finished pulling her tunic off, exposing her bare torso.\nThe sight immediately enraptured Emil, as it well should have. His eyes trailed along her well defined figure, toned yet not without some of the supple charm of a woman.  Her fair skin allured the young man closer. To say nothing of her blessed chest. Tales could be woven about the maiden standing before him, casually baring herself more and more with each removal of cloth.\n“I mean, I won’t force you if you do not want to. I just figured it had been some time since either of us had had a bath.” Alex said as she removed her leggings and tossed them aside. She ran her fingers through her braided long hair and undid the knot, whipping her head to and fro so the flowing locks could free themselves. The mesmerized man came to a rest at her feet, head craned upward.\n“I-I’ll join you.” Emil nodded as fervently as any sensible man in his situation would.\nAlexandra smirked. “I had a feeling you would.” The giant turned her nude form away and stepped into the water. Deep, deep into the water; and yet the pool only barely covered her stomach despite the giant standing in the middle of it. The temptress smiled and turned back with her finger enticingly gesturing Emil to follow.\nAt some point Emil had stripped himself and ran as Alexandra’s finger guided; all of it a blur to him as his eyes never left the giant vixen tempting him to come closer. The water was pleasantly warm to the touch, wasting no time in starting to wash away all the dirt and stress of the last few days. Deeper into the water he swam in pursuit of the giant, who seemed more than a little content to keep stepping back and teasing the man.\nOver a dozen meters away Alex came to a stop and turned, the water now level with her chest. “Come now, surely you can swim faster than that.” She teased, lips twisting into a playful smile at Emil’s attempts to swim towards her. Every time, without fail, he would draw near and the giant would take a step back. “Getting tired already?” The giant laughed after the fifth time it happened.\n“Of course not.” Emil wheezed.\nSuch bravado made Alexandra laugh. Finally, she came to a halt, as did Emil once he neared her bosom. The knowledge that the woman was watching did nothing to prevent his eyes from looking ahead to her bare chest. Just beneath the water’s surface her nipples were barely visible. If he looked carefully he could see them, although they were muddled by the murky depths. Perhaps…If went beneath the water… After all, her entire body was down there. Over a hundred meters of giant female splendor hidden just out of view. Her beautiful figure was right there. All it would take would be a quick dive and he could experience it all for himself. If he swam fast enough maybe he could get away with it.\n“I wouldn’t advise it.”\n“Huh?” He stared up into the giant’s knowing gaze, the lustful haze beginning to clear from his mind.\nAlexandra shrugged. “You could try if you want but even the most athletic Attendant I’ve ever had couldn’t make it to my bellybutton, let alone everything beyond.” She grinned. “It wouldn’t do for my bath toy to pass out on me before we even begin you know.”\nEmil could feel one of the giant’s fingers tickle at his feet. The innocent smile steadily grew more devious as the finger moved up. “Or perhaps I could explore your body. Hmm?” The digit came between his legs. Her head came in close, close enough Emil could feel the warm breath from her nostrils breeze past him. Her lips were within reach. It would be such a simple matter to swim over and…\n“I-I think I’m clean now. I’ll go dry off.” He stammered out with a flushed visage.\nThe giant clicked her tongue. “Damn, fine. Get to shore then.” She leaned her head back and pouted. Beneath the water’s surface her finger retreated as well.\nHe cursed his cowardice but what was he to do? Sharing a lake with such a woman, a woman who technically owned him no less. What was she trying to do? Any more of that teasing and he may have done something stupid.  Hell, he knew he would have. The last thing he needed was tempt fate and get himself crushed between Alex’s fingers for being a lust-ridden fool. What he needed distance, distance to clear his head a little. After allowing one more longing look to his giant superior Emil paddled towards shore.\nThe current sure was strong though. Emil wasn’t the best swimmer by any means, but he liked to think he was pretty good. Yet, try as he might the shore didn’t seem to be getting any closer. Minutes had passed and yet there he was, still right beside Alexandra. He didn’t even need to turn to know that. Her blonde hair floated precariously along either side, almost surrounding him in a blonde jungle.\n“What’s the matter? Weren’t you going to go dry off?”  \nThe question was immediately met with suspicion from the Attendant. On a hunch he poked his head below the water to take a look. The view was murky, but sure enough, there her hand was, casually pushing the water towards him. It was no wonder he had made no progress. The woman had him trapped in her own personal little current!\n“Was wondering how long it’d take you to notice.” Alex snickered upon Emil’s resurfacing. All at once the currents that had been holding him back subsided. Nearby the hand that was the culprit broke the water’s surface. Her index finger stretched out and pushed against Emil’s chest.\n“Not going to let me leave?” He sighed in defeat, wrapping his arms around the blonde’s fingertip.\n“You can try.” She grinned. “What’s the matter? Never seen a woman bare before?”\nUnfortunately for Emil, the question hit far too close to home. He reeled back as if physically struck, face the brightest of reds. Even the daftest person could read the signs clear as day.\n“By the Gods. Really?” Alexandra’s eyes widened. “All those years and you never…? Not even in the bathhouse?”\nEmil turned to hide his shame.\n“Come now Emil. There’s no shame in it. It’s just…surprising. A charming lad like you I’d have figured would have had at least one small peek at some point. A childhood friend…The neighbor’s mother…Me.” She laughed.\nThis was not happening right now. He was not getting this from a giant of all people. No way in all the seven hells. Emil refused. He just refused to even have this discussion. Thankfully, it seemed like Alex got the idea sooner rather than later.\nEverything went silent for a moment, and then a shadow fell over Emil. Probably nothing worth looking back for, most likely just Alexandra stretching her arms or some such nonsense. But then the torrent of water bore down on Emil. A well’s worth of water came crashing down. “W-Wha?!” He flailed in surprise as the wave overtook him. His head turned just in time to see the blonde culprit grinning deviously at him.\nAlexandra didn’t even bother to hide the cupped hands that were holding another pool of water ready to go. “What? I thought you could use some help cooling off.”\nWas this woman serious? Emil wiped his eyes and looked up at her with the deepest of frowns.\n“You look mad.” The giant stated the obvious.\nEmil sighed. “I am…I’m mad you got the first strike!” He laughed as he launched his own surprise attack with a surprisingly large splash. An impressive amount of water assaulted one of Alex’s breasts, much to her pleasant surprise.\n“Oh ho.” She grinned. “You are a bold man to challenge me. Few dare to try and even fewer survive.” Alexandra boasted as her fingers released the pool of water onto Emil.\nHe was convinced of it now. It was impossible to stay mad at this woman. With just a single smile and splash Emil felt silly for pouting over something so trivial in the first place. He laughed as the splashes batted away at him, returning fire with a few quick strikes of his own. In a matter of minutes he’d already forgotten whatever it was that had embarrassed him in the first place.\nThe water danced around the giant’s neck, never quite reaching her looming face. At the very least it did a good job of wetting her torso. “Not bad at all Emil. Now let me show you what I’ve got!” Alexandra pulled her hand far back, far, far back, and pushed with all her strength. What came next could only be described as a tidal wave. Emil never had a chance. It rose a dozen feet in the air and effortlessly battered Emil under hundreds of gallons of water.\nThankfully, most of the blast missed him and soared right over his head, but there was still enough force to send him below the water’s surface. The waves were chaotic as water ran in every direction. Up, down, left, right, it all lost all meaning as the typhoon took hold. The young man was a helpless ragdoll until the waves subsided and he could resurface. He gasped for air as he came back above the water.\n“Not bad at all Alexandra. I dare say you……win…?” Emil trailed off as he looked around the lake.\nEmpty.\nThe giant who had started all the mayhem was nowhere to be seen; but before he could begin to wonder what was up a large bubble erupted nearby; another soon followed. A great shadow was moving below, too deep in the water to make out. Another bubble popped up not even an inch beside him. He could feel the air rushing past his legs and something touching the soles of his feet. Were it not for the myriad of other shenanigans Alexandra had put him through he may have well been worried.\nThe shadow began to rise, growing steadily clearer. A familiar blonde head came into view under the surface just beneath Emil, showing no signs of stopping. Two blue eyes peered from beneath the water with an all too familiar playful look in them. Before he knew it Emil saw the water parting for her head, and something catching him between his legs: Alexandra’s nose. He straddled on it like a horse and held on for his life, his calm exterior giving way to a flushed nervousness.\nAlexandra dominated his senses. Everything he could see, smell, hear, even feel, all of it was her. The roaring waterfalls of liquidthat poured from her body. The soft, wet skin he held onto and how it squished in his grasp. Her distinct, feminine scent mixed with the natural smell of water. And of course her eyes that never deigned to peel away from his small form hanging onto her nose.\n“Is that a twig or is someone happy to see me? It’s so small I can’t tell.” Alexandra smirked. Upon realizing his nudity Emil scrambled to cover himself, earning another laugh from the giant. “I’m kidding Emil, it’s quite cute. No need to be embarrassed. Everything is small to me.”\nEmil turned his head and pouted. “I should’ve kept my trousers on.” He groused.\nAlexandra shrugged. “There’s no point in being modest with me little one. With a relationship like ours it’s best if there are no secrets between us.” Her fingers plucked the Attendant from nose and held him before her like some sort of bug. “It’s only natural I get to see you naked after you see me naked don’t you think?” One eye winked.\nWhile simple, there was a level of sense in her logic. Not that Emil would give her the satisfaction of admitting it to her face. He just kept his pout going and did his best not to betray his thoughts. “Can you set me down?” He asked as calmly as he could given the situation.\n“Certainly.” Alex nodded. Except he wasn’t being set down, he was being lifted. Alexandra’s head was poised below as she looked up at him. Her tongue danced around her lips to provide a very unsubtle hint. “Hope you don’t mind. I’m a little famished.” She offered a toothy grin.\nShe wasn’t serious. There was no way. But still, images of the previous Attendant’s death flashed in Emil’s mind. Alex had no problem snapping him up when she was done. What if she was done with him already? By comparison to a manly man like Andrei Emil was so much less interesting. What if he already bored her? What if the incident from the last night was the final straw? Even if logic told him it was another game that did nothing to settle the goosebumps as Alexandra’s lips parted.\nHe’d seen her mouth before. In fact probably everyone in Windermere had, but never like this. There was something predatory in her eyes, something carnal. Strings of saliva broke as her mouth opened wide, revealing the pink, fleshy chasm eagerly awaiting its offering. “Ahhh~” Hot breath rushed up Emil’s legs.\n“O-Okay Alex this isn’t funny anymore.” The young man began to laugh awkwardly; all too aware of how easy it would be for Alexandra to drop him to his death right now.\nShe didn’t bother responding. If there was any sort of reaction then it was her lips curling up just before her fingers let go. The game was over. She really was doing it. As he realized that a deafening scream filled Emil’s ears. A moment later he realized it was his own screaming. Alexandra’s warm breath rushed over him. For the second time in recent memory he could feel his fate approaching. This was it. What were the odds he’d die in the first week? Even by Attendant standards that was pitiful.\nAnd then Alexandra took a step back.\nIt was a simple move. So simple that it didn’t quite click in his head. It was as if she had done the impossible. Just like that her body was now out of the way and all that remained below was the pool of water. He spotted Alexandra shut her mouth and watch him fall. Only then did it finally all clicked, right as he made contact with the lake’s surface. The giant’s booming laughter was audible even when submerged, only adding to the Attendant’s embarrassment.\nAlex brushed tears from the side of her eyes. “Did you honestly think I would eat you?” She asked between giggles once he resurfaced.\nEmbarrassment very quickly turned to annoyance. “Of course I did! Why wouldn’t I?!” He yelled back.\n“Because you’re my Attendant. I’d never hurt you.” Alex replied simply and leaned back. She paid little mind to Emil as her body began to surface, giggling as his little form was caught on top of her. All the muscles in her body relaxed and let her figure in all its marvelous glory float along the water. She smiled and relished the light splashes of the waves, and of course, the human who was now positioned atop her stomach. “You really need to loosen up Emil. Relax. Enjoy life.” The giant hummed peacefully.\nAs little of it as I have left. Emil mentally remarked. He really should’ve been used to it at this point. Something about this woman just had him constantly wound up. Maybe it had something to do with her toes being almost as tall as he was.\n“Haven’t had an Attendant this skittish since Hue.” She commented, moving her hands behind her head.\nEmil looked back at her. Or rather, what he could see between her breasts. For once he didn’t seem to notice their allure, more enticed by her words than her bosoms. “Hue? The Hue? The first Attendant? Skittish?” He blinked. I would’ve expected he would’ve been the stoic type.”\nAlex chuckled as if he’d told a joke. “Not at all. Sure, he was strong for a human, but almost every day for the first few months he was terrified I’d eat him or step on him or some other thing. Probably didn’t help I liked to tease him about it. But it was just too cute.” Her voice grew enraptured in its nostalgia.\n“So even he had his vices.” Emil sounded amazed by what he was hearing.\n“Oh child you have no idea.” The giant’s stomach rumbled beneath the young man with suppressed laughter. “You humans love to romanticize your history and those in it, but take it from someone who was there. The man was an oaf with muscles bigger than his brains, but thankfully not as big as his heart.” She giggled. “He was kind. The first human to ever actually attempt a proper dialogue with me too. The days we spent together were fun and full of laughter. Best I’d had in hundreds of years by that point.”\nAlexandra’s words were amazing. If that was true then it brought one question to mind. “If things were so great then…Why did you replace him?”\nThe question hung in the air; Emil immediately regretted asking. The carefree air between the two vanished. His question was met with silence for the longest time. “All good things must come to an end Emil.” Her reply finally came in a whisper. “One day the laughter stopped. The well of joy dried up. And without that…Well there was no point in keeping him around was there?” She closed her eyes and sighed. “Once your toy stops being fun to play with you get a new one.”\nFor the first time since being selected Emil remembered who he was speaking to. It really was as simple as that. Alexandra was a giant, somebody who had lived for hundreds of years, a different species altogether. His entire life would be less than a fraction of hers, so why would prolonging it or cutting it short matter? There wasn’t any malice in her words. It was just how it was. Even so…She sure seemed sad about it. “There has to be more to it than that.” Her tone fueled his curiosity. “He did something didn’t he?”\n“It wasn’t what he did. It was what he didn’t do.” Fingers wrapped around Emil and cast him in darkness. The roaring sounds of waterfalls dripping from Alexandra’s body told him she had stood up again. “This conversation is over Attendant.” Her voice was ice cold as her palm opened. Just over the edge he spied her clothes and boots. They were back ashore. The warmth in Alex’s eyes was gone. “Spend the rest of the day cleaning out the inside of my boot with that tongue of yours. I’ll pull you out for dinner. Until then.” The hand tilted unceremoniously, dropping him into the awaiting leather boot. Emil could only blink as her tremor-inducing footsteps went away as quickly as they had come.\nThe mood swing caught him by surprise, as did the scent that assaulted Emil’s senses after a couple moments. The bars of Windermere undersold just how worn the innards of Alexandra’s boots were. Once he was done reeling, Emil had little choice but to get on all fours and begin his work of absentmindedly lapping away at the insole. It tasted of decades of sweat and grime, but it may as well not have for all he noticed. The Attendant’s mind was elsewhere: on his giant compatriot. As always, the blonde giant confounded him. Just this time it was more than usual. What did all this mean?\n \n","Alexandra made no sense. That was the only explanation.\nIt was only now, a full day after having been made to clean out her boots that Emil reached that conclusion. She’d barely said a word to him the rest of that day. No games. No playful banter. Just several hours of her boots, dinner, and then finally sleep. Were it just that it would’ve been understandable, but why in all the hells did she wake him up with such a wide and happy smile? How was he supposed to take such mixed messages?\nThe tasks she gave were nothing to hit home about either. More of the same really. By this point Emil had more or less adjusted to her antics. It was her mood itself that unnerved him. It was as if the mood swing yesterday didn’t happen at all. Now she was taking it easy on him. Did she honestly forget? Was she upset and too shy to apologize? Maybe that was it; but what could this woman be shy about? She’d been nothing but brazen and direct since day one and suddenly she developed modesty? Unlikely.\nA long time ago a wise man once said drunkenly in a bar, “No creature is as destructive and confounding as a woman.” And it was only now that Emil began to really feel the hearty truth of those words weigh down on him.\nNight had now fallen and like every night prior the two sat before a massive campfire. Emil with his own little scraps of meat and Alex with her skewer of a dozen oxen. After some time on the flames they were rather delectable. The night was silent as they gorged themselves after another long day.\nWhat was this, day four? Day five? Longer? Already the nights began to blur seamlessly together. Time with Alexandra always flew by so quickly. Whether that was a blessing or a curse Emil had yet to decide. Though he could his life finally gaining something resembling normalcy. At least, as much normalcy as one could have in his position.\n“Emil.” Out of nowhere Alexandra spoke, her eyes never leaving the flames. “You’ve shown excellent progress as my Attendant.” She paused, seemingly choosing her next words carefully. “I… think you’re finally ready for one of the most grueling tasks I can ask of you. Think of it like a test. If you can do this you can handle anything I ask of you. Once we’re finished eating we’ll begin. Please prepare yourself.”\nThat was a statement. Not an order, nor a request, but a stated fact. The giant was making it clear this, whatever it was, was happening. “Okay.” A strange sense of acceptance welled within him. If she felt he was ready then maybe he was. But still, her vagueness troubled him somewhere in the corner of his mind. What could possibly be more demanding than what he has done already? Not even a full day ago he’d spent several hours on all fours licking away at her shoe. He’d pushed through the dryness of his mouth, the taste of her sweat, and conquered the will crushing odor; and that was just the latest of many, many tasks. Compared to all that what more could she do?\n“I apologize in advance if I do anything foolish.” Blue eyes looked away from Emil awkwardly. Alexandra’s lips, which usually offered nothing but smiles, retracted into her mouth. Her fingers danced along the base of her skewer. It was a stunning sight to behold. She was nervous. She was genuinely, unironically, and very obviously nervous.\nEmil could only gawk at this rare display. “D-Don’t worry about it. Comes with the job.” So even a giant could get embarrassed over something. He never would’ve guessed. Question was what would cause such a reaction? As dangerous as it likely was; Emil had to admit, his interest was piqued.\nThat was all that was said on the matter for the rest of the meal. Alex had no interest in going into detail before it was time and yesterday taught Emil it was best not to ask questions whenever Alexandra didn’t want to linger on it. But as the food went away and the embers of the fire slowly dimmed they sat in silence. Finally, Alexandra set her skewer down, letting out a soft sigh.\nHer hands reached for her tunic, undoing the straps of her clothing and just like that it was off. Emil barely had time to process what she had done before her boots were set aside as well. Then of course came the pants. Even now the Attendant remained silent, transfixed by the blonde giant’s bare body in the moonlight. A distinct smell permeated the air. Luscious and enticing, it instinctively told him what he was in for, and it both scared and delighted him.\nIn a smooth motion Alex seated herself in front of Emil, both legs landing on either side. Her bare body casted a shadow over him, looming overhead. “Even a giant has needs.” She explained. Then after a moment adding on, “It might be for the best if you do this naked. Otherwise your clothes will get ruined.” She added on with an awkward blush.\n“How do I even…? I mean…” Emil gulped, eyes never leaving Alexandra as he stripped himself. The darkness hid it well; but the glistening womanhood was there, hidden just beneath a small tuft of blonde hair. The Attendant took steps towards it, the cold night air against his skin made the warmth Alex radiated all the more enrapturing.\nAlexandra remained silent and imposing, her body darkened by the moonlight. From the corner of his gaze he spotted her hand working at one of her breasts. “Just start rubbing. Then as I get…excited I’ll guide you. This is your first time so I’ll try to be gentle.” She managed a chuckle.\n“Even now you’ve got jokes.” He came to a stop in front of Alex’s crotch, hesitant to proceed.\n“Go on.” She encouraged, sliding her fingers down to part open the lips for her Attendant.\nCoherent thought fled as he looked at the hole before him. A pink cavern as tall as he was, dripping wet and awaiting him, already shining in the night with a light veil of womanly juices. Its smell was mind numbing. Its allure irresistible. It was as if Emil was in someone else’s body, watching someone else act. His hands came up as requested and pressed into the sides, taking hold of the inner lips.\nAlexandra bit her lip. “Yes…”\nHands began to rub along the walls, Emil leaning forward to reach further in. The hypnotic smell and sights were stronger than ever. The massage began slow, painfully slow even, but after a few moments his palms began to glide around the slick surface with more confidence. Amateurish as he was, even Emil could discern where to hit and where to avoid based on his giant owner’s moans and silences. Her arousal began to give birth to his own. To think a couple days ago he was a pitiful man who’d never seen a woman naked before. Now Emil was between Alexandra’s legs, witnessing her in all her nude glory. His head was blank, driven only by the commands he heard from above. Nothing else mattered at this time. It was him and Alexandra. That was what his heart was telling him.\nOn the sides of the vulva Alex’s fingers tightened their hold. “Harder…” She whispered, her voice growing heated.\nOf course Emil did as commanded, putting all his arm strength into his massaging. Alexandra’s waist jerked in response, followed by another command to keep going. His fingers sank into the warm flesh and rubbed away. It was subtle at first, but now even in the dark Alexandra’s excitement was plain as day. Juices dripped from the top of the cavern and slid along the edges, only growing in volume as Emil worked. Above Alexandra’s hand clenched her breast as hard as it could. “That’s the way. Faster.” She moaned.\nSo she asked, so he did. Emil leaned further in. There was a squishing sound as his torso pressed against the bottom of the giant’s lips. Juices continued to rain down, soon covering him in their sticky musk. Though all Emil did was focus on his job; it was all he could focus on. As though his body operated on its own. The thick walls surrounding him quivered at his touch. In a way it was strangely cute. For all her jokes and smiles, it was here where Alex could hide nothing. Emil had a small temptation to make all of it quiver before him, quickly tossing such a silly notion aside. Strange that one such as he would be so level headed right now. To think his first would be Alexandra. Who would have ever imagined?\nAlexandra pulled her head back and let out a loud moan. All sense of her normal self was lost in that carnal sound. “Use your mouth.” She demanded in a husky tone. “By the Gods…” Her entire body was shaking.\nYet another request. Naturally Emil was going to comply, but…a playful thought popped into his head as he looked up. In spite of all his efforts he had yet to toy with his owner’s clit. Perhaps this latest order would be a chance to remedy that mistake. He stood back up, hands keeping Alexandra busy as he came face to face with her sensitive spot. Inexperienced as he may have been, he had spent enough time in taverns to know the vital importance of this one spot. So it was only natural that he gave it a quick kiss and bite into it.\n“Ah!” Alex let out the cutest little yelp instantly. Cerulean eyes glared down at her Attendant from on high. “You told me you had never done this before.” Her rosy cheeks puffed in a stern pout.\n“I haven’t. I just know a number of particularly open lipped drunks.” Emil grinned.\nShe rolled her eyes and leaned back. “I didn’t say stop.” The giant frowned and went back to playing with her breasts. Despite her protests she was very clearly enjoying it. As was Emil surprisingly. His instincts guided his actions, one thing seamlessly weaving into another almost as if he knew what he was doing. Hands continued to explore the giant’s innards as his mouth toyed with her clit. Even someone as small as he could play this woman like a fiddle with the right motions, Alex was putty in his relatively small hands.\nFaint arousal very quickly became maniacal lust as Alexandra’s breaths grew more ragged and untamed. Her hand left her breast and went down towards her Attendant, large fingers pressing against his back. “Deeper.” She commanded.\nEvery survival instinct he had told him that doing so would be a bad idea. Although lust overrode it all and got Emil to nod and poke his head inside, submerging his torso within Alexandra. The vaginal walls pulsated in tune with her heated breaths, contracting and compressing around his body. He was being simultaneously smothered, squeezed, and drenched all at once, and it felt splendid.\nPerhaps it was something in the musk ridden air or maybe the blonde giant’s otherworldly appearance. Whatever the reason may have been, Emil relished the feeling of being inside of her. Heat welled within his loins as his body brushed against her sensual area. Things he would have been too prudish or nervous to do normally suddenly became the most natural things he could do. Massaging her, giving her walls loving kisses, squirming around to pleasure her as much as possible. It was all done on instinct for their mutual pleasure. Alex’s moans grew louder with more frequent and sharper breaths. Her sexual juices rained down harder than ever and coated the Attendant from head to toe. It appeared that Emil’s efforts were working far too well.\nThe finger resting against his back suddenly pushed harder and forced most of the Attendant deeper inside. Everything grew dark. Alexandra’s fingers held him by his ankles and pushed him even further in. Her nethers clenched tightly around him, the blonde woman reeling in pleasure. Which was fine for her, but for the man inside of her things very swiftly began to take a turn for the worse.\nAir grew scarce as his body was continually crushed from all angles. Any and all protests and screams only seemed to fuel the giant’s lustful fervor. Her moans grew louder and louder as her fingers pulled Emil back and forth. In and out in and out, over and over again ad infinatum. His control taken from him, Emil could only struggle in vain as Alexandra pleasured herself with his insignificant body. His figure was soaked in the woman’s love juices, forced to constantly wheeze through them for what little air there was.\n His pain was her pleasure. Her constricting walls allowed him no movement, only effortlessly and quickly squeezing the life from him. It was only by the forceful will of her fingers that Emil was able to move at all. Bones creaked and groaned with each squeeze of Alexandra’s sensual lips. Every few seconds there would be a contraction and with it the saving grace of a little bit more air. Were it not for that he would most certainly have fainted already.\n“Oh God Emil!”\nOutside of his lewd prison were the clear sounds of Alex screaming his name to the Gods, totally lost to the mindless thralls of pleasure. Her hips bucked as the pleasant feeling in her loins grew to unbearable levels. The floodgates had begun to open. Then, suddenly the unyielding pleasure all gushed out of her in one final wave. The giant slowly began to relax, panting for air as the heat washed from her mind. Between her legs rested a thick puddle of release, slowly seeping into the ground.\nAfter a few seconds the stark realization hit her. “Emil!” Alexandra shot upright, her mind clearing at last. She looked down between her legs and saw him, splayed across the ground in the ankle-deep pool of sexual juices.\nNot moving.\nThe sight made her azure eyes widen. “Don’t you dare…” She whispered under her breath. “Get up.”\nNothing.\nHer fist smashed a crater into the dirt. “I said get up!”\nIn spite of her orders the man did no such thing.\nIt crept in slowly: the realization. Alexandra’s face twisted, contorting into an unpleasant form as her eyes began to water.\nJust as the tears began to slide down her cheeks the still figure lurched forward, coughing. Each hack brought forth thick clumps of love juice. Easily several gallons worth were spat into the dirt. Yet slowly, Emil managed to look back up at her. “Dangerous huh?” More coughs. “You weren’t kidding.” He offered the giant a faint smile despite his heavy gasps for air.\nFor once the mouthy giant had no rebuttal. Her relieved smile said it all for her. “What can I say? I warned you.” She wiped her cheeks with a sniffle.\n“Who would’ve thought the Great Alexandra couldn’t control herself once she gets a little riled up.” Emil chuckled weakly.\nAlex’s face was the brightest of reds. “It’s been a long time okay?! Besides…You were really good at it…”\nEmil pretended not to hear her embarrassed whisper. “Hope you don’t mind if I take tomorrow to rest up? I sort of can’t feel my…anything.” He squirmed in place. Even his fingers were too heavy to budge. “Nothing seems broken though. Just numb.”\n“I see…” Alexandra’s hand came in again with Emil lacking the strength or desire to resist it. He was brought up to her lovely face, before that brilliant gaze. “I certainly did some damage didn’t I?” Her lips were set into a distant smile.\n“Nothing a day of rest won’t fix I think.”\n“Look at you acting all tough. And to think a few days ago you wouldn’t even say a word to me. Now look at you.”\nHad it really only been a few days since they had left Windermere? He supposed it had been about a week. How strange. It had gone by so quickly and yet felt so much longer than that.\nA giant finger running down his torso pulled Emil from his thoughts. “There you go again. Thinking too much.” Alex giggled, adjusting to lay flat on her back. “If you keep doing that you’ll miss the next part.”\n“There’s more?” A bit of dread crept back into Emil’s tone.\n“Of course.” The blonde retorted. Emil found himself set along her breasts near the bottom of the woman’s neck. “You’ve been very patient with me Emil. It’s been a bumpy road. Despite your clumsiness and lack of particular talent you’ve learned remarkably fast.” She smiled down at him. “And for bearing with me through my…desires…I think you deserve a reward.”\nHer finger trailed along his body once again, venturing past his waist to the nether region. Although he was largely numb a soft bit of pleasure began to well from his loins. The soft digit gently rubbed at him; he was too weak to even try and muster up the fluster to push it away.\n“There.” Alexandra’s hand pulled back to make way for her face. She carefully leaned forward and gave her Attendant a kiss. His tiny body found itself caught between the plush softness of her lips and the firm softness of her breasts, no doubt intentionally. It was like a blanket had enveloped him, lightly massaging away his pains with a gentle warmth. “Just stay still. Let me handle this.”\nEven if he could move Emil had no intention to. This peaceful feeling, this pleasure growing between his legs. He never wanted it to stop. Giant, pink lips rubbed against him, and from between came out the familiar tongue in all its wet glory. It brushed up against him, wiping away the sexual juices that had begun to dry along his body and replacing it with a liberal coating of saliva. Not that he minded. Even this felt nice. It cleansed him of the filth, leaving a facsimile of saliva that felt brisk in the cool night air.\nAlex remained silent, focused only on diligently performing her task. First she cleaned her Attendant of her lewd juices, and then her tongue went further down. Numb as it was Emil’s body was visibly aroused by her actions, and for once he was too exhausted to fight it. In one simple wave of her tongue the pleasure intensified. Life began to spark back in his numb limbs as the heat spread from his loins across his entire body.\n“A-Alex…” Her name was all Emil could say. He watched the blonde at work. It still seemed too good to be true. There was going to be a twist, or a joke, or some trick. But it never came. The pleasure built and built upon itself until it became too much. Alexandra’s tongue was masterful in how it was handling him, bringing euphoria even after everything he’d undergone. “G-Get back…” He gasped to the giant, but she didn’t so much as budge an inch.\n“Thank you.”\nWith those cryptic words Emil finally lost it. His own release came gushing out, landing all across the giant’s tongue. She paid it little mind as the tongue finally retracted. the little bulge in her throat going down as she swallowed. Her lips went back to their joyous smile.\nWhatever willpower that had compelled Emil to remain awake finally left him with his climax. His eye lids grew heavy and the world dark. The last thing he saw before sleep took him was Alexandra’s happy smile.\n \n","It must have been hours before Emil’s eyes fluttered open. At least that was what his internal clock said; though the sky was still dark so it didn’t seem like it had been too long. Aches and pains confirmed what he already knew: that the vivid and lewd acts running rampant in his mind did in fact happen. His body sounded off a series of pops as he sat upright. He groaned under his breath and looked ahead. Even half asleep he could tell something was amiss.\nOr rather someone.\nDozens of feet away sat Alexandra, dressed in her tunic and leggings once again. Her eyes were turned skyward to the moon on the horizon. She made no movements even as her Attendant wearily stepped over to her. Like her, Emil sat down and looked up into the sky. Everything was still, and it remained so for at least ten minutes. Just the two of them admiring the starry sky.\n“It’d be fifteen years ago today.” Alexandra suddenly broke the silence.\n“Hmm?” Emil gave her a curious look.\nThe giant ignored him and went quiet once again. After a while the familiar rumbles of her chuckles sounded. “Tell me Emil, do you know why I chose you as my Attendant?”\nThis again? She’d asked this once before, and his answer remained the same as it did back then. “No. You told me it was just on a whim. No special reason.”\n“I did didn’t I?” Alex ran a hand through her blonde locks. Emil couldn’t help but admire her in the moonlight. There was a sort of beautiful stillness in her visage, like a portrait come to life.\n“Once, many years ago. There was a boy.” She began. Her human companion went silent and listened. “It was during a festival of some sort. Some human mating period or some such I think. Boys were to propose and offer gifts to the women they fancied. Even in all my years I never paid the ritual much mind. After all, it had nothing to do with me. But this one year there was this one child, a plain looking boy who was usually too clumsy to keep up in the other children’s games. On that day he approached me.” She said at length with warmth in her voice.\n“I’ve always liked playing with children. They’re innocent. They don’t care whether I’m a giant or some other creature. But still, imagine my surprise when this boy offered me a handful of flowers and weeds and said the most outlandish thing. Do you know what he said to me Emil?”\nThis was…familiar. He couldn’t place it, but the young man felt he knew this story. The dots were slowly connecting. “No, I don’t.”\n“He said to me ‘Momma said I’m s’posed to give flowers to pretty girls today and yer the prettiest girl in town so I gots as many as I could.’ Can you believe that?” Alex laughed.\nFor reasons long since lost to him Emil felt the heat rush to his face. “He sounds like quite the kid.” He joined her in laughter.\n“He really was.” She smiled. “I was blown away. In all my years never had I been approached like that. Other giants? Sure. But a human? They always cowered in my presence. Even children who adore a giant playmate know better than to get too involved with me. But this kid didn’t. He was different somehow, and it got me thinking.”\n“What about?”\nAnother pause, followed by a sigh. “A lot of things. It made me question so much. All my decisions. Of involving myself with humans. Abandoning my fellow giants for a life in the middle of nowhere. It was such a flattering gesture. I was so happy to accept the child’s gift; and yet at the same time it reminded me of how truly alone I was in Windermere. I figured perhaps it was time to return to my own kind. Go back to the days of raiding villages for playthings and the copious amounts of wanton sex.”\n“But you didn’t.” Emil noted.\nAlexandra nodded and turned her head his way. “You’re right. Do you know why?”\nIn fact he did. “The boy.”\n“Right.” She smiled. “You could say that boy had caught my attention. Without even realizing it I began to always keep a watchful eye on him. I watched him grow up. I witnessed him stumble his way through adolescence, lose his parents, and so much more. Like any other child he slowly drifted away and forgot that he had anything to do with me. But even as he stopped joining the children to play I kept regular eye on him. Curiosity turned to fascination. Fascination became wonder. And wonder became…” Her hand crept closer to Emil and petted his head with a finger. “…adoration.”\n“And so…one year you chose him as your Attendant.” Emil finished for her.\nShe didn’t need to answer. “I’m a rather selfish girl. When I see something I like I must have it. Others don’t see it, but I do. Perhaps I did even back then. You might not be the smartest or strongest; but you persevere, and you’re kind, and I adore you for it. I kept away from you for so long Emil. I didn’t want you to become like the others. But this latest year I just couldn’t hold myself back anymore.” Alexandra laughed dryly. “I am the Great Alexandra, respected giant of Windermere. Practically a ruler of this land. Who was I to be denied the one human I wanted? He will be mine, damned be the consequences.” The blonde shook her head with a bitter smile. “My mistake I suppose.”\nThese revelations had left Emil stunned, unable to do little more than nod along. “What do you mean like the others?”\nThe giant turned back to the sky. “All good things must come to an end Emil.”\n“You said the same thing the other day when you brought up Hue.”\n“So you do pay attention to what I say.” She chuckled. “It always begins the same with my Attendants. They sulk at first but soon grow enamored with me. Then it’s all fun and games and happiness, but then…” Alex sighed. “A year is but a blink in the eye for me, but to you humans it is a long time. Much can happen in a year. You can grow jaded, bitter, and even the most positive of feelings can turn into resentment. Especially if someone separated you from your loved ones.”\nHe blinked. “You’re saying they ended up hating you?”\n“Nothing quite so simple, but eventually…yes. Some sooner than others. Some remained in denial to the end. But all of them stopped looking at me with the same warmth.” The blonde tucked her knees against her chest and rested her arms atop them. “I can’t stand to be looked at like that.”\n“So you kill them. Quit while you’re ahead and move on to the next Attendant…Before you get too attached.”\n“One lay and suddenly it’s as if you can read my mind.” Alexandra laughed. “But you’re right. I’ve killed enough humans in my life to not reflect too much on it. To a human it must seem heartless and cruel, but to me well…” She shrugged her shoulders. “Just one of thousands really, but to forget them is a disservice. I remember all of them, and all of our happy nights together. Just as I will remember the ones with you.”\nThere it was again. That melancholic tone Alexandra had whenever her previous Attendants came up. Something about it was infuriating. “So if I ever end up growing to dislike you you’ll replace me too?”\n“Not if. When.” She stated flatly. “I’ve tried countless methods over the years. Invariably my Attendants are ostracized and grow to despise me. You will hurt more than most. But that’s the price I pay for my selfishness I suppose.” Alexandra sighed. “My apologies Emil. These last few nights have left me in a rare mood. Pay these ramblings little mind and focus on enjoying yourself as much as possible would you? For me if nothing else.”  She parted some hair behind an ear and smiled. “It is important not to sully the good while it lasts.”\n“A little easier said than done.”\n“Don’t front. You’ll fall asleep the second you lie down.” Alex chuckled. “You handled yourself quite well. The idea of finally having you inside me…I couldn’t stop thinking about it and I ended up getting a little carried away. But you made it through. Congratulations.”\n“I’m honored to have survived your waterboarding.” Emil replied dryly.\n“Hey! You got to experience me in all my glory and live to tell the tale. I’d consider that a gift!” Alexandra pouted cutely.\n“And I’d consider it a torture.” Her Attendant rolled his eyes with a thinly veiled smirk.\n“You’re joking, but this one Attendant I had, Martin. His story ended a bit differently.” She grinned. “Poor fellow spent a month getting into my pants and once he did it was the end of him. At least he died happy.” Emil had no joke for that story. Though his silence made Alexandra laugh all the same. “Get some rest Emil. As I said. Pay this conversation no mind and consider it the ramblings of a moody woman.”\n“But I’m not tired.” It wasn’t a lie either. Emil was as wide awake as ever. His body ached. If he fell over exhaustion would take him in a second. But there was no place he wanted to be more than right here. “You mentioned your days as a roaming giant. What was that like?”\n“You truly are talkative tonight aren’t you? And here I thought most human men liked to leave the second they got their sex.” Alexandra chuckled. “There’s not much to say really. Just the standard giant life.”\n“Which is?”\n“Pillaging, slaughter, rampant sex.” The blonde shrugged her shoulders. “We are born feared and attacked by you humans. So we strike back in kind. When you live to be as old as us societal boundaries and the concepts of life and death lose most of their meaning. Life becomes a matter of existing for pleasure since that’s the only thing that never changes. Not much of a life to be frank. Although it is certainly fun while it lasts.”\nIt was one thing to hear of the tales of giants from legends and myths. It was certainly another to hear it from the giant herself. “That sounds…”\n“Horrifying?” Alex grinned. “Don’t worry, I’ve heard it all before. I have no delusion that I am anything but a monster. A pretty monster mind you. Beautiful in fact, but a monster all the same. Such is life.” She crossed her legs and sighed, wandering her gaze back to the sky.\n“If that’s all true then why would you leave that life? I mean…It’s not like you cared much about humans before coming to Windermere.” Emil asked, curious.\n“Even hedonism gets old after a while. At least it did for me. One day I got into a spat with my friends and I left. Simple as that. Went to live my life in the mountains like my ancestors. Imagine my surprise when even in the mountains I find a village.” Alexandra let out another chuckle. “So I figured why not start anew? Oh the look on Hue’s face when I asked.”\nEmil gaped. “You asked him?”\n“Begged really.” Alex laughed. “It was too cute watching him try to piece together what I was up to. Hue was the sort of human who you could always tell what he was thinking before even he did. The rest is…Well…History.” She shrugged.\n“History is still kind of vague on the details. What happened between you two?” Emil kept his eyes on the giant’s expression, staring expectantly.\n“Well aren’t you just all about prying into my past.” Alexandra smirked at him. Was he really that obvious? “It’s not much of a story I’m afraid. I convinced him to do it and we worked out an arrangement. Over time we became good friends, but of course…You know how that story ends. No matter the era humans have always been the same.”\nThis again. Emil could already see the somber creep back into Alexandra’s visage. “Why not tell me more about your other Attendants? Until I get tired that is.”\n“Are you still not tired?” The blonde looked at him with surprise.\n“Afraid not.” And even if he was, Emil had never seen the giant quite like this before. He’d be a fool to walk away from such an opportunity to get to know her.\nAlex smiled and scratched her cheek sheepishly. “Well…About a hundred years back there was this lass named Emilia. Very prudish girl with a temper like you wouldn’t believe…”\n \n","Thus Emil and Alexandra spent the rest of the night together. The giant talked at length about her many Attendants and their misadventures and Emil listened to each story with the utmost fascination. For Emil it was nothing but enthralling. Through these stories, these memories, it almost felt as though he was speaking with Alexandra for the first time. Almost like he could finally begin to understand her. After quite literally coming together they were finally having a proper dialogue. No incessant teasing, or witty remarks, or playful banter. Just sincerity. It was...nice. Strange, but nice.\nHe had been a fool. Everyone in Windermere had been. Whenever he or some other villager looked at Alexandra they never truly saw her. They saw a giant. They had always seen Alexandra for what she was but never who. It was only now that Emil shared the realization that his many other fellow Attendants likely had. That as blatant and obvious as it was, she was a person just like any other. Realizing that he never even thought of it like that just made the young Attendant frustrated. Moreso at himself than his peers.\nDespite her size and tremendous power, the fact remained that at her heart, at her core, Alexandra was still a woman. She had feelings like any other person, feelings that were trampled by humans for hundreds of years. Countless decades of being called a monster and attacked or feared. It was only natural that she responded to those fears in kind, living a life of destroying villages underfoot like the monster they made her out to be. Nobody once ever tried to treat her as anything but. Then one day she found a chance.\nNobody knew what happened between her and Hue during the first Pilgrimage. Alex may have hinted at it, but even now the bulk remained unknown to Emil. Legends had always played up the mystery, but Emil felt as though he could understand Hue all those years ago. How he must have felt when he discovered this town destroying monster actually had a heart, that she wanted to stay with them and would offer her knowledge and support. That behind all the thick skin and smiles laid a very lonely woman.\nThe revelations plagued his thoughts throughout the night long after he and Alexandra collapsed from exhaustion. The pieces began to connect. Perhaps not perfectly, but well enough he felt he could understand the woman.\n“Alright, ready Emil?” Loud words brought him somewhat back to his senses. The sun had long since risen on a new day and with it the two were to make their trip back to town. That fateful dream of a night was actually two days ago, but in their exhaustion the duo managed to sleep an entire day away. Alexandra rested nearby and was lacing one of her boots. Her eyes and smile were as warm and joyful as ever, as if the entire night hadn’t even happened.\nNearby the Attendant nodded, his own visage bearing a similar smile. “One thing first Alex.” He began to walk towards her, heart pounding in his chest. With all this time spent resting he had a plethora of time to work out his thoughts. On everything.\nYes, she was lonely. Very lonely. Why else would a woman be so insecure that she demand at least one person spend every waking hour with her? In hindsight it was so glaringly obvious to him. Perhaps her reasoning wasn’t perfect. In fact, he as certain it wasn’t. She was as misguided as everyone else, just in her own way. But in spite of that, and with plenty of time to reflect on everything he had learned, one thing became crystal clear.\n“What is it my little Attendant?” Alexandra stared at the human by her bare foot curiously.\nWithout saying a word Emil crouched down to the giant’s big toe, fully aware she was watching. He came in close, stopping mere inches from the flawless toe nail. “Thank you for choosing me to be your Attendant.” Without any fanfare he kissed the nail appreciatively and quickly stood back up, rubbing his lips.\n“Emil…?”\nNow that he knew everything he was certain of it. He adored this woman. Or perhaps he always had ever since he was a kid and he just forgot. Either way, a large part of him welled with joy at getting to be the center of this woman’s attention. The idea of spending his remaining days with her…Suddenly they didn’t seem so bad.\nAlex stared blankly. As if she couldn’t believe her eyes. “H-Hey what’s gotten into you all of a sudden?” She laughed. “Trying to butter me up for something?”\nEmil shrugged. “Not especially, I just felt like being honest for once. Your toes are kinda cute, and I still owe you for saving me from the wolves.” He said plainly. “Plus it’s been a while since I kissed your feet right? That’s one of your personal favorites. I can’t forgo my duties right?” Something resembling a playful smirk crept onto his face.\nThe giant blinked. “Um…Are you okay Emil? Do you have a fever? Stricken by some sort of sickness?” She leaned forward with a look of concern.\nThere was his chance. Time for him to man up and say it. “I suppose I am. Lovesick.” He said, completely straight faced.\n“…”\nAlexandra simply stared before bursting into a thunderous fit of laughter. “Of all the nonsense you could say!” She keeled over while holding her stomach, the laughter only getting worse. “The lack of sleep must have driven you daft!” The edges of her eyes were watering. “To say such a silly thing!” Her building-sized feet slammed into the ground in a series of countless earthquakes.\n“H-Hey!” The Attendant flushed bright red. “I’m being serious here! That took a lot of courage to finally say!”\nImmediately the laughter died down. Alexandra turned her head to look at him. “By the Gods you’re serious.” She sat back upright, looming over him once more. “Do you have any idea what you’re saying? Don’t let last night cloud your head and give you any ideas Emil. You are my Attendant. Our relationship has not changed beyond that.”\n“Do you think I’m lying?” The young man defiantly stepped forward with a hand pressed to his chest.\n“I think your head is clouded from exhaustion.” She stated flatly.\n“Well I think it’s not.” In proper stubborn fashion Emil came to a stop before Alexandra’s towering form, standing before her toes. “I’ve been…thinking. A lot.” Of course his words would suddenly escape him. Curses.\nAlexandra’s eyes narrowed skeptically. “Clearly not enough. I told you what becomes of my Attendants. Don’t set yourself for failure Emil. Much as I favor you, you are not different from the countless humans I’ve met over dozens of life times.”\n“And what if I am?” God, he sounded like such a stubborn child right now. Even so Emil refused to let himself back down.\n“You’re not.”\n“I think I am.”\n“You’re wrong.”\n“You’re stubborn.” Emil fired back, countering each line with one of his own. “Didn’t you say you adored me?”\n“I did, and I do. Which is why I’m telling you to cease this bravado. You’re not proving anything.” The blonde shifted her form, resting her arm on a raised knee. “You aren’t the first Attendant to ‘fall’ for me and claim to be different from the others.”\nGoodness this woman was beyond stubborn. “Well I’m the first one to truly mean it.”\nAlexandra laughed. “Are you now?” The giant tilted her head, obviously fascinated by what nonsense her Attendant was spouting. “And? How do you intend to prove that?” She asked skeptically. “What makes you different from all the others? Aside from being perhaps the mouthiest?”\nEmil, perhaps stupidly, said the first thing that popped into his head. “I won’t ever hate you like they did.”\nSilence.\nHow many minutes rolled by to let that declaration hang in the air? Neither could say. Emil immediately regretted his words. He should’ve explained himself better. He should’ve said something cleverer. He should’ve…Just done something else. But what was done was done. All he could do was wait and see how Alexandra would react to his child-like statement.\n“…Do you mean it?” The giant asked quietly, sounding almost hopeful.\n“I do.” He calmly replied. “I mean; it’s not like I had much before this. No living relatives, not especially popular…I’m definitely not the best person to work the fields. In a strange way, this job kind of suits me. I think…I just needed some time to get used to it. But I see no reason why I’d end up like all those other Attendants. I don’t care if the villagers leave me alone. And I don’t have much of a family to miss either. All I have is…Well…You.”\nThe blonde giant shook her head, lips twisting into another smile. “Of all the nonsense…” She chuckled and turned away. Although he couldn’t see, Emil was certain there were a semblance of tears on her cheeks.  “That’s a big promise to make you know.” She sniffled. “For all you know, once a year goes along I might just get bored of you. You’ll certainly hate me then. I get most vindictive when bored.”\n“Then I better make sure I stay interesting then huh?” He knew what he was saying. How he was making an appeal to a woman who had seen countless examples to the contrary. He didn’t care.\n“Yes, I suppose so.” Alex laughed with another loud sniffle sounding off. Her hands rubbed at her face for a good minute before she turned back. “I must be even stupider than you. Because I think you actually mean it.” The blonde smiled wanly. “I’ll hold you to it then.” With an expression like the one on her face one would think she had just been proposed to. “Stupid Emil.” She couldn’t stop giggling.\n“Hey, you chose me.” He protested, cheeks flushing red. “Anyway, I just wanted to get that off my chest. I’m ready to leave whenever you are.” Emil turned back and moved a few steps away. He figured It was best to move along quickly before he got too embarrassed. Truth be told he didn’t expect his sudden proclamation to work. It took much self-control not to betray his own internal giddiness.\n“Typical man.” Alexandra chuckled. “You get a woman’s heart going and then you wanna get a move on like nothing happened. Insensitive.”\n“You can lecture me on the road.” Emil replied dryly. “Speaking of, where am I going to be this time? Not dropping me down your shirt again are you?”\nThe answer he got was a shrug. “That was the plan, but after that little speech of yours I think it’d be best to keep things…Oh what was that word you used? Ah yes, interesting.” Alexandra leaned forward. “I did have one thing I’ve always wanted to do with an Attendant…” The giant’s lips turned into a grin Emil had come to know never meant anything good.\n“Which is?”\n“Wearing them in my boots.” Alexandra flashed a hopeful look to Emil. “Think about it! You get to spend all day under me. Taking the brunt of my every step. Soaking in my sweat. Breathing in my sweet scent. I promise not to crush you too hard. What do you say? I think it’s a good arrangement.” She nodded with a confident playfulness to her blue eyes.\nEmil sighed and laughed at the same time. This damn woman; and yet he was the insensitive one for moving things along. “Just be gentle.”\nBefore he even finished, Alexandra’s fingers had already plucked him and hovered his smaller form over her remaining boot. “Oh! And if you get thirsty I hope you don’t mind the taste of sweat. It’d be oh so much work to pull you out of my boot every time you needed a drink.” She grinned mischievously, very obviously awaiting the signature protests from her Attendant.\n“Okay.” Emil shrugged. “I’ll find a way to make it work I guess.”\n“What?” Confusion filled the giant’s expression. “I-I mean…I guess if you’re fine with it…” Emil was gently lowered into her boot. “You sure about this?” Her voice called from the outside world. “I’ll be marching all day. It’s going to be hot in there. I’ll probably sweat a lot too. Are you sure?”\nEmil cupped his hands along his mouth and looked up to the boot opening. “We’re losing daylight while you meander!”\n“Fine! Have it your way!” Alexandra pouted as the boot soon grew dark with her bare foot filling the opening. “Just for that I expect a proper massage while you’re in there. No breaks!”\n“What a slave driver.” Emil had to get one last quip in before the foot rolled in and brushed him aside like he was nothing. He was pushed back to the toe area, pinned beneath the massive digits where it rather quickly grew humid. In no time he felt his temporary prison moving and the foot pressing down on him every few moments.\n“I don’t feel you kissing!” The giant laughed playfully as she began the long march back home.\nDespite the casual crushing, Emil had the faintest hints of a smile on his face. He did as commanded, leaning forward to press his lips against the underside of Alexandra’s toes. The faintest of grimy sensations brushed against his mouth. With everything he’d been through over the Pilgrimage it was nothing to fret over. Considering who it was he was kissing, it was even somewhat enjoyable. Not his favorite spot by any means, but a favorable one.\nEven if he despised it, it would all be worth it for next time, when he’d ask for his fantasy of riding in her trousers. If she wanted to make absurd demands then two could play at that game. Oh yes.\nYeah, so long as it was this woman he could see himself putting up with a lot. She was his owner, his guardian, and perhaps if time permitted, his lover. Her feelings were true, and if the revelations had taught Emil anything, so too were his. Not a fleeting infatuation. No, this felt…deeper than that. Although deeper, more intrinsic feelings and their implications were lost on the relatively straight-minded young man.\nAll he knew for sure was that at first his selection as Alexandra’s Attendant terrified him. But now the idea of spending all his days with her sounded rather nice. His heart said he would do anything for that woman; and knowing her that’d be a lot he would have to put up with. What the future would hold, or even if it would be half as kind and simple as Emil made it out to be in his foolhardy proclamation. He didn’t know. All he would do was try his best. Though it would be worth it. All for that refreshing smile of hers.\nAfter all, he was her Attendant.\n \n","“…And then it was just me. My comrades were down and the dragon was all that stood between us and our mission.”\nAlexandra told her story excitedly, waving her hands in generous fashion for her audience. As she sat atop the building a number of children surrounded her booted feet with only the occasional parent towering over the younglings. The giant blonde pounded her chest, a wide, toothy grin on her face. “Twas a fearsome creature who stood twice my height. Scales coat a deep red in the blood of all he’d slain, with large, snapping jaws. His flames were stronger than any I’d ever seen and melted my sword into nothing but a pile of molten metal. With all my comrades down it fell upon me to slay the beast!”\nThe children oooh’d and ahh’d, seemingly blown away by the story the beautiful giant was weaving. Even their parents were engrossed despite having heard it a dozen times over at least.\n“Funny, last time you told that story the dragon was barely taller than you and you had a sword hilt.” Of course, there was always a voice of skepticism.\nAlex’s eyes widened as her head shot to her feet, where a young man had just rolled a barrel beside her boot. “I think you’re mistaken Emil.” The blonde stated with a slight flush to her cheeks.\nHer Attendant heaved the barrel filled with ale right-side up and wiped fresh sweat from his brow. “And the time before that the dragon was shorter than you. I even think you had half a sword and a companion.” He smirked playfully at Alexandra. Seeing her get flustered whenever she got called out never ceased to be amusing. Now was no exception.\nThe giant gave him a stern look. A look that said he could expect to be massaging her for hours later on for this. Emil took the chance to snicker, furthering her blush. “W-Well, whatever my Attendant may think. The fact remains that the dragon was a dangerous foe and I was unarmed.” She cleared her throat, decidedly avoiding looking at Emil and focusing solely on her captivated audience.\n“How did you beat the dragon without a sword?” One wide-eyed child asked. Whether he didn’t believe Emil or didn’t care, he still seemed as impressed as ever.\nWithout fail someone always asked this question when Alex told the story. Her response was immediate. She grinned and leaned down until her face was just above the group. “I rushed the beast head on!” Her bellowing voice blew the children’s hair back. “Caught off guard by my quick-wittedness, I managed to wrap my arms around his scaly body. His neck was by my teeth, and without a blade I had no choice…” Her teeth chomped, scaring the poor, enthralled kids into the ground.\n“Easily the worst meal I have ever had.” Alexandra pulled back, laughing. “But after a few more bites the creature finally bled out and the day was won. All thanks to me.”\nHer story was met with applause and children shouting about how they would one day slay a dragon just like Alex. Emil smirked. It wasn’t that long ago he himself was among those youths giving Alexandra awestruck looks. Now doing so was just his job. Funny what a bit of time did to a person.\n“You got any more stories Lady Alexandra?” It was inevitable after that performance the kids would want more.\n“Another story eh? Hmm…” The blonde tapped her lower lip. “Maybe the time me and my friends rallied an army? Or maybe…” Her blue eyes ventured over to Emil, mischief filling them. She bit her lip as if a passing thought excited her. Whatever that look meant, the Attendant knew it wouldn’t bode well for him. “Would you kids like to see a trick I picked up in my travels?” She asked.\n“Yes!” Came the unanimous response.\nAlexandra nodded. “I thought you would. Emil! Fetch me another barrel of ale.”\n“You haven’t even touched the last one.” The young man griped as he looked at the barrel that he painstakingly rolled over to her boot.\n“What did I say about talking back to your betters?” Alex frowned. Something about being in public always had her acting a bit smugger than normal.\nEmil lazily scratched his head. “I dunno, but you asked me to be nice while we’re in public. That what you meant?”\nThe look on Alexandra’s face was worth the hours of foot massages and lip service he’d have to pay later. “Y-Y-Y…”\n“Relax, I’m joking.” He laughed. “On it your Greatness.” The young man turned and walked off before Alex could get the last word in, a victorious smile on his lips.\nIt had been about a month since their return to Windermere. The Pilgrimage they went on seemed like a distant relic of the past. A lifetime ago really. Since then though, things had gone rather smoothly. Better than that in fact. With time, tending to Alexandra proved ever easier as Emil slowly grew stronger with each passing day. Not to mention there wasn’t a hint of apprehension in their interactions anymore. Was this what it was like to be in a comfortable relationship?\nBy day Alexandra did as she always had. Played with children, told boisterous stories, and just generally helped around the town with this or that. All the while Emil tended to every whim she had. On the surface it was the same relationship any Attendant had ever had with her. Although Emil was…different. As he did just now, he wasn’t afraid to speak back to Alexandra. He wasn’t afraid to laugh at her expense, or to face her wrath for embarrassing her. Quite the contrary, he often looked forward to it in a miscreant sort of way. It added a different flavor to their relationship than other Attendants. One that the town seemed to pick up on but for the most part not address.\nBesides, the real fun in their relationship was in the night, away from prying eyes. When they were both free to leave the town and make camp as they always had. It was then that they could speak freely. Small talk, chats about life, love, rumors, even the occasional dabbling into philosophy. Of course, there were…other things they did. Things that were the subject of many bar rumors and the specifics of which were best not to think too much about lest he got distracted.\nEmil soon reached the town brewery. One of them at least. “She wants another.” He piped up to a man surrounded by barrels filled with Alexandra’s favorite brew. He simply gestured to a barrel, otherwise remaining silent. “Thanks.” Emil offered a grateful smile and pushed aside a barrel at random, rolling it back where he had come a moment later.\nThings weren’t perfect of course. He was still adjusting to the bulk of the town giving him the cold shoulder. Even if he seemed different from other Attendants thus far there was still a stigma that came with it. One that likely wouldn’t be going away any time soon either. Emil’d be lying if he said it didn’t bother him. There was definitely a feeling of loneliness that came with his new position, and while he couldn’t see it particularly affecting him in the long run; it wasn’t unthinkable to imagine someone else in his position growing to despise Alexandra for it. It was what it was however. No point in dwelling on something he couldn’t help. Or on people long gone from this world.\nThe bottom line was that he knew he was different from those other Attendants. Even if nobody else knew it, or even if Alexandra herself didn’t realize it, he knew it, and that was what mattered. He’d made a promise to the giant, and as simple-minded as it was he intended to keep it. It certainly didn’t hurt that failure to keep it might end in his death, or that keeping it meant he had a beautiful, giant lover to call his own. That may have had something to do with it too.\nBefore long Emil returned, fresh barrel in tow. “Here it is.” He grunted and sighed as he soon saw the first barrel still hadn’t moved an inch. Nonetheless, he rolled it into position by Alexandra’s towering boot and caught his breath.\n“Excellent, now I can show these children my trick.” The blonde smiled and reached over. One by one her digits plucked the barrels and dropped them into her open palm.\nAdmittedly Emil was curious where she was going with this. That is, until the fingers returned and were moving towards him. “A-Alex!” No amount of struggles could have saved him from being dumped into her palm along with the barrels.\n“Oh relax. You know I’d never hurt you.” Alexandra wore a devious smile.\n“No, but you like to come too close for comfort.” Emil grimaced. Karma for his earlier comments sure came fast this time around. He peeked to the side of Alex’s palm, debating on whether a fall from this height would kill or seriously injure him. He didn’t care to find out.\n“You kids ready then?” Whatever the blonde had in store for him, it looked like he was about to find out. The children waited in anticipation. “Behold!” Alexandra proceeded to skillfully toss a single barrel into her other hand.\nThe sudden jerk of her wrist made Emil lurch, his head dazed from being knocked around. “Ugh…” He groaned and attempted to brace himself. Without missing a beat Alexandra proceeded to toss the first barrel into the air and the second into her now empty palm. “Oh no…” Dots started to connect as Emil pieced together her trick. She wasn’t…\nBefore the first barrel could land back in her palm she threw Emil himself and caught it, and then the next moment she threw Emil, caught a barrel, and tossed another. The woman was juggling! With him no less!\n“Not funny!” Emil felt like he was going to be sick as his world began to spin in every possible direction. Those words were his last for a while, replaced either by nausea-induced silence or nervous cries as he was tossed like a ragdoll. Direction lost all sense of meaning. Right was left. Up was down. The world was on its side and then it wasn’t. All of it a blur of rapid movement as he was tossed from hand to hand in spite of any voiced protests. At least the children seemed to be enjoying it. Not that Emil could see them. What with the world being a blur and all. \nAlexandra wasn’t particularly gentle about it either. For the sake of maintaining her juggling she had to be efficient, and efficient meant she couldn’t slow down for Emil’s sake. Although, thanks to his recent quips he doubted she wanted to anyway. He could only vaguely process the incoming palm of the giant moments before crashing into it with a painful thud. Then, before he could begin to react, he was tossed into the next hand for an equally grueling landing; and then he was thrown into the air to repeat the cycle all over again. All in less than a couple moments.\nEmil was certain he was going to vomit ten seconds in. Yet, through some miracle, he’d lasted over five minutes without spewing out the contents of his stomach. The children were enthralled, and Alexandra simply hummed a merry tune whilst she casually juggled. Of course, she was taking great care not to hurt him, even Emil could realize that. But damn if it wasn’t grueling in its own uniquely hellish way.\n“And now it’s time for the big finish.” Alex grinned as her hand tossed a barrel up especially high. Without missing a beat, she leaned forward with her mouth ajar, where the barrel crashed into her awaiting maw and broke upon impact. She briefly savored the taste before swallowing, humming joyfully. All while she continued juggling Emil and the other barrel; though it wasn’t long before she threw the second barrel and did the same thing once again.\nWith only Emil left, she tossed him especially high. Finally, free from spinning for the moment, he could feel the dizziness begin to subside. The world remained wobbling and slowly came into focus. Alexandra’s immense frame. Her radiant blonde hair. And her mouth. Her open, salivating, eagerly awaiting him mouth. Which naturally he was heading right towards.\nIt was a favorite game of hers to see who would cave first in these situations. Her Attendant was no stranger to her mouth and the sights it offered. Be it the thick globules of saliva or the thin facsimiles of spittle connecting her pearly white teeth in strands. None of it was anything new; but invariably Emil always caved. Primal fear overriding the common sense that this was all simply a game. “A-Alex!” He cried out.\nVictorious, Alexandra closed her mouth and grinned. Her hand came up to her breast plate and pulled it back to reveal the bosom beneath. Just by casually adjusting herself, she assured that Emil landed in the depths of her cleavage, crashing against the breasts with a bounce. Alex released her top, effectively sealing him inside.\n“Ta-da!”\nThe children laughed and clapped. “More! More!”\nAlexandra smiled sheepishly, rubbing the back of her head. “Maybe later okay? I think I gotta go check up on some things. Besides, I think my Attendant’s feeling a bit dizzy.” After assuring the children she’d be back to amuse them later, she stood back up and waved everyone goodbye, finally walking away.\nMovement rustled from her bosom as a tiny head poked from her shirt. “Not….haaaa….haaa…funny!” Emil looked like he was ready to puke.\n“Really? The children seemed to disagree.” Alex smirked. “Maybe next time you can think twice before interrupting one of my stories.”\nThere was a witty rebuttal and some sarcastic remark in there somewhere; but for the life of him Emil was too worn out to make it. So instead he settled on grumbles and shooting the blonde a death glare.\n“Don’t pout at me. I’ll make it up to you later.” She chuckled. “Seeing you flail around helplessly like that put me in something of a mood.” The giant added with a bit of a sultry tone.\n“Lucky me.” Emil averted his gaze, very clearly interested in what the blonde was offering but too stubborn to admit it. He sighed and nuzzled against a breast. “You better make it good.” He groused like a pouting child.\n“Only the best for my Attendant.”\n“You’re lucky you’re cute.”\n“And you’re lucky you belong to a cute woman.” Alexandra fired right back with a smug smirk.\nEmil rolled his eyes and got cozy, wearing a faint smile of his own as Alexandra wandered towards her next whim.\n \n"],["Attention! This Story features Giantess Vore, Digestion, and a final scene with a soft scat! You read at your own risk!\n\nBe Careful What You Wish For\n\n“So would you really do it if you found me shrunken?”\n\n\n\n“You know it doesn't turn me on. But I've answered your questions so many times that I'm genuinely interested in some way. Also answering you.. Yes! I would eat you and not let you go ;-)”\n\n\n\n“Wow, are you absolutely serious now? What if I've already shrunk and I don't want it? Would you do it against my will?\"\n\n\n\n“Writing about it with you piques my curiosity, and I know full well that somewhere in the middle of it you really want it! Stick to one. You asked me many times if I would eat you. I did not want! You waded through and told me what an interesting experience this could be!”\n\n\n\n“You know, it's good for me to imagine or discuss it with you. Still, if it turned out to be true, I don't know if I wouldn't change my mind after just getting smaller.\"\n\n\n\n“I wouldn't be interested anymore. The moment I find you little one, I will eat you ;-). I'm going to sleep now... Sleep well! ;*\"\n\n\n\n\"Good night! Sleep well ;*”\n\n\n\nI put my phone on the nightstand. The confusion in my head wouldn't let me stop thinking about it. In the end, I convinced her myself. On the one hand, it's quite exciting how she changed her attitude. Madeline is my very good friend. I never believed in male-female friendship before, but it changed my perception. I treated her a bit like a family member, we were never sexually attracted to each other. Once I felt the need to talk about my erotic fantasy. To my surprise, Madeline did not laugh at me, on the contrary, she waded into it and tried to put herself in the situations I presented. She was reluctant at first, saying that if it happened in real life, she wouldn't do anything! Over time, however, our conversations seemed to convince her that digesting me could be something special.\n\n\nI went to sleep, it was quite late. I had a dream where Madeline finds me baby and eats me without any remorse. It is true that this dream stimulated my excitement, but translating it into reality seemed to me quite ... terrible? It's been a pretty rough night for me. \nToday is Friday the last day of work! it was seven in the morning, the first thing I went to wash and tidy in the bathroom. Once that was over, I put on a white shirt and blue jeans. I grabbed my phone and house keys and left. I locked the house and as fast as I could I went towards the bus stop waiting for the bus. At that time I fired up my phone, emptiness. On the one hand, it saddened me that apart from Madeline, I hardly write with anyone. Is there something wrong with me? The bus arrived. I got in, I'll be there in a few minutes.\n\n\nAfter an hour we reached our destination. I slept the whole way in the back seat of the bus. I left and went straight to my office. I was so lucky in my life that Friday turned out to be one of the nicest days. My working day was short, and there was not a lot of traffic. I sat down at my desk and started filling out charts and writing reports.\n\n\nThe hours passed quite slowly, despite the fact that I was quite focused on my work, yesterday's conversation with Madeline was still on my mind. Suddenly my phone vibrated and I rushed like crazy into my pocket and checked my notification, it was a message from Madeline.\n\n\n\n“Hey Peter! Just got home from college and thought I'd like something sweet to eat! I went to the store next door and looked through all the available chocolates! And you won't believe it! Wasn't my favorite!!!! >.< :-( It's better that you don't show yourself to me now, little one, because I'm craving something sweet so much that I couldn't resist ;3”\n\n\n\nMy heart skipped a beat, and it's not the first time Madeline has teased me like this since I confessed my fantasies to her. I turned slightly red.\n\n\n\n“Madeline! Not now, you know I'm at work! I'll message you back when i finish my work\"\n\n\n\"Ehh... :-( Just don't make my tummy wait too long <3\"\n\n\n\nSame feeling again. I put the phone down. My thoughts did not allow me to concentrate. Is she really just playing a role? is teasing me? Or would she really eat me without any remorse? I couldn't stand it any longer. I grabbed the phone.\n\n\n\n“Madeline, if it really happened… Won't you feel guilty afterwards? You know you consumed me and all that…”\n\n\nI waited a while. No answer. I put the phone down and went back to my work. Time began to fly faster for me now, column after column. As soon as I finished my today's tasks, it was time to finish my work. It's going to be a pleasant day, I thought, and hurried out of the office. Barely leaving the building, a speeding passer-by bumped into me. He was dressed like a scientist, and he was holding a briefcase in his hand. we both fell to the ground.\n\n\n\n“I am very sorry sir! I am in a hurry!\"\n\n\n\nWithout giving me a chance to answer, he just ran away. I got up and started to brush myself off when a tiny vial on the ground caught my attention. It must have happened to this scientist. I picked up the vial and looked behind me. He disappeared from my view. Well, looks like I'll be taking a vial with me! Who knows, maybe I'll even make some money from it! I put the vial in my pocket and headed to the bus stop. I did not have to wait long because after only a few minutes my bus arrived. I got inside and pulled out my phone. Two unread messages from a few hours ago. Damn it! Didn't hear notification? I fired up the app right away.\n\n\n\n\"Absolutely not! As I already told you! You've been asking for it for the past few months since you've been asking me your questions! You told me that you like to play the unwilling, so I would take your objection in such a way ;-)”\n\n\n\n\"I'll be honest, having such an opportunity with little you, I couldn't resist.. I'm very curious if the feeling I told you would be the same if I actually swallowed you whole <3\"\n\n\n\nI got excited reading these messages. Maybe she would actually eat me in such a situation, but then let me go? Although she mentioned that she doesn't like throwing up...\n\n\nThe way back passed quite quickly, as soon as I returned home. I changed into looser clothes and sat on my bed. I took my phone\n\n\n\n“Well, on the one hand, it's good that it's impossible! Looking at what I made of you cruel ;-)”\n\n\n\n\"Hahaha! Remember! You chose me for this! You said yourself if you ever got smaller you wouldn't mind ending up in my stomach! ;3\"\n\n\n\n“Actually, you're right, if I was in your place and reading everything I wrote to you, I would probably get turned on too haha!”\n\n\n\nThe topic of my fantasy and what she would do took a back seat, we started a normal conversation, she told me about her day and so on. After a while, I put my phone aside for a moment on the bed and grabbed my earlier clothes. My mother always told me to put everything in the closet right away. That was golden advice, at least there wasn't that much crap in my apartment! Grabbing my pants, I felt something hard in my pocket. I put my hand in and pulled out a vial with a strange liquid inside. On the vial was a note written in small print, \"Shrunk Fluid.\" A strange thought crossed my mind, but it's impossible, it's probably some new drug that is supposed to help soothe the skin or whatever. I looked at the vial and brought it closer to my face. There's no way it'll work, and there's no life-threatening stamp either. I decided to unscrew the vial and drink the contents. You only live once! they say, so what's the harm. I drank and sat back on the bed grabbing the phone and reading her life story. After a while, something gently tugged at my heart. My eyes turned white. I fainted.\n\n\nI don't know how long I woke up. I felt like I had been sleeping forever. I felt like I was trapped in something, everything was dark. I felt like in some kind of soft black tunnel. There was a faint light behind me, so I decided to head in that direction! After a few minutes I left. This was my room. Huge room. Turns out the tunnel I came out of was my T-shirt. I looked at myself, I was completely naked. I panicked and excited at the same time. How is that even possible? What I should do now? Madeline is my only friend! Should I take a chance? My phone showed up. It was as big as the biggest tables for me. I climbed onto it and started jumping on the keys. Good thing the screen sensed my weight. After entering the password, I launched the application and started texting Madeline\n\n\n\n“Madeline!!! It's not a joke! I really shrunk! Please come to my house, I'll be on my bed, the door is open\"\n\n\n\nShe read. A moment of silence, I wasn't surprised at all, who in their right mind would believe such a thing? Good thing Madeline was a little crazy. On the one hand, I felt fear, on the other hand, this is my only resort, I have no one else I can trust. My thoughts were interrupted by a horribly loud notification sound\n\n\n\n\"Oh you pervert, you can't stop talking about your fantasy even for a moment, could you at least respect and tell me what you think about what happened to me today ;-(\"\n\n\n\n“I'm really not kidding! I'm shrunken! I'm hopping on my phone to send you a message. Please, Madeline, come, you're the only one I can trust\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay, I'll be there in 30 minutes. If this turns out to be some stupid prank, I'll be really mad at you for wasting my time.\"\n\n\n\nIt worked! Now I had to wait. Instead of rejoicing, I was filled with fear. Madeline is crazy, but she's my friend. I guess the stories end here? Part of me was excited about getting into her mouth, but on the other hand, I knew what it meant.\n\n\nTime flew by for me very long. It felt like ages. I was lying naked on my bed thinking about all this. The combination of excitement with a hint of fear was a really interesting experience that I have never experienced. Suddenly I heard the door opening. Loud footsteps heading my way when Madeline suddenly appeared.\n\n\n\nMadeline was short and blonde. She was 158 cm tall. She had a pretty face, especially her mouth and teeth. I've imagined them in action many times. She wasn't a skeleton but she wasn't fat either, somewhere in between I think. Big thighs, big tits and a flat stomach. Plus her long blonde hair down to her shoulder blades. She was wearing a short orange sweatshirt revealing her belly and black jeans.\n\n\n\n\"Oh my God! You weren't lying! But how is that possible?”\n\n\n\n“While leaving work today, a scientist bumped into me! He dropped a vial and then, well... I drank it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hahaha! But you're stupid, didn't Mom teach you not to play with questionable toys?\"\n\n\n\n“I well um.. hey!!”\n\n\n\nAt that moment, Madeline grabbed me with her two fingers and lifted me to face level, her big brown eyes studying me very closely. I felt ashamed of trying to somehow cover my crotch\n\n\n\n“I really didn't believe it would ever happen! But since you've already applied to me, there's no need to delay!\"\n\n\n\"Wait! Madeline! You must be kidding! You have to help me get back to normal!\"\n\n\n\"Oh no little one! I know you did it on purpose! I'm sure you wanted this until I came here! Remember, it's your fantasy, so have fun with it!\"\n\n\n“But.. But.. No!! Wait!\"\n\n\n“Aaaa!”\n\n\nShe opened her beautiful mouth and greeted me with her tongue. She licked me twice causing my whole body to be in saliva now. Without waiting any longer she just put me on her tongue closing her mouth. I was half in her mouth with my legs still sticking out. I started screaming and fidgeting. All I got was a cute laugh in response. I didn't have to wait long when my whole body was sucked inside.\n\n\nMadeline was throwing her friend from cheek to cheek. Savoring and sucking every nook and cranny of his body. She decided to arrange his clothes, then reached for the vial. There can be no traces. She thought as she headed straight for the restroom. There she broke the vial and dumped the remains down the toilet, flushing the contents. She was humming the last of the hits as she happily walked through Peter's apartment.\n\n\n\nHer tongue was really strong, throwing me left and right. I was no match for him. I was thrown from cheek to cheek, sucking my body in the process. I was excited on the one hand, I always dreamed of this situation about this. how he plays with me in his mouth, but on the other hand, the fear of what was to come prevented me from fully focusing on the pleasure. It didn't last long though, the rubbing of her tongue against my crotch caused an unintentional arousal that I couldn't hold on to any longer. It went straight to her tongue. I was wondering if this little speck would be felt at all. There was silence. She stopped moving. Suddenly her tongue pressed hard against my palate. Then her mouth opened as an unfamiliar liquid spilled over me, pushing me into the dark abyss behind me\n\n\n\nShe was always playing with her little friend. Madeline went straight to the kitchen pouring herself one of the orange juices. She was glad because orange juice was her favorite. As soon as she poured herself some juice, she felt a strange taste on her tongue. She immediately turned red. She pressed Peter against her palate and quickly drank the juice\n\nGULP GULP GULP GULP GULP GULP!!\n\nAaaah!\n\nSatisfied, she sighed as she felt one thicker mound slide down her esophagus. She stood there for a moment, curious. Will she feel anything inside at all, will the feeling he described to her in his questions be real.\n\nThe orange liquid took me in the current, before I could understand what was happening I was sucked into a dark tunnel in the background hearing the sound of swallowing. I was falling along with the juice, which made it hard for me to catch my breath. My worries were quickly averted when suddenly I fell into a wet and small room, orange juice mixed with digestive juices reaching my knees for now, I felt a slight tingling sensation. That's how I pictured her stomach. It was practically empty. Slowly I started to realize what was going on, I accelerated as fast as I could and hit one of the walls.\n\n\n“Madeline! It's not funny! Let me out!\"\n\nAfter a while she felt a gentle struggle in her stomach. She felt something moving inside her! She liked it very much. In addition, she couldn't believe how very quiet she was able to hear it!\n\n\n\n“Wow! I really feel you! It's so cool! How did you know this was what it would feel like?”\n\n\n\n\"Are you even listening to me! Let me out!\"\n\n\n\n“This is the first time I've heard food address me like that! Better behave! Maybe I'll rethink it all.\"\n\n\n\nShe giggled softly, patting her belly, and quickly left the apartment. She got into her car and started the engine, rubbing her stomach.\n\nThe slap threw me to the other side of my stomach. I could not believe! She really is crazy! She really got into it. I felt her start walking in the background hearing more or less what was going on. When she sat down, my stomach tossed. I heard the sound of a car.\n\n\n\n\"What are you doing? Where are you going?\"\n\n\n“Well, where? To my home!\"\n\n\n\n“You must be joking! What if you start digesting me on the road? You'd better stay with me, I can stay here as long as you want, but if I start to burn, please let me go!\"\n\n\n\n“Food won't dictate my terms. So let's hope my stomach would not digest you while I'm driving! Now be quiet! I need to focus on the road!”\n\n\n\nI felt a strong slap that threw me to the other side of my stomach again. I could not do anything. Only with her help can I get out of here. It was hot but not too bad. I tried to get her attention but she completely ignored me. The smell of orange juice allowed me to endure the smell, which was not the best anyway. For now, I felt fine, but the sounds coming from her stomach stressed me out.\n\nThe road passed quite quickly. She parked the car and got out of the car heading straight for her family home.\n\n\n\n\"Hi Mom, Hi Dad, I'm back!\"\n\n\n\nShe went straight to the kitchen where the whole family was having dinner. She walked over to the pot, helped herself to a plate of soup, and joined the family, discussing life and politics.\n\n\n\nI finally felt a change in her stomach, she started moving, that means she's getting off! So she has arrived! I don't know how much time is in that stomach. It's still not too bad, but my skin is starting to tingle a little. I wanted to try to make myself known, but her movements threw me off balance. Suddenly I could hear a conversation outside. I was thrown up again when I was nervous, I was about to start screaming at her, a strange liquid fell from the top straight on me. It was tomato soup mixed with chewed noodles. Well beautiful! She must be kidding me! Furious, I approached one of the walls and started punching, the fluid level in her stomach began to increase.\n\n\n\nSuddenly a strange feeling from her stomach knocked her out of the rhythm of the conversation a bit, she rubbed herself gently remembering about her little friend. She heard his quiet screams softly, it was hard for her to assess how much they were audible to the people next to her. Not wanting to risk it, as soon as she ate her portion, she put the plate in the dishwasher, thanked her parents for the meal and quickly went towards her room. As soon as she got inside, she threw herself on the bed as fast as she could.\n\nHer stomach started to rumble left and right again, I was already feeling a bit battered. The worst was about to come when, after feeling her footsteps for a moment, she sped up and I suddenly felt a strong pressure against her stomach. It knocked me down a couple of times before I found a stable position. I was now full of her digestive juices, orange juice, and tomato soup.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, you still alive there?\"\n\n\n\n“Madeline! Stop fidgeting so much! You're giving me a rollercoaster here! I think I've been in your stomach long enough! It's time you let me go!\"\n\n\n\n“Are you crazy? I just ate lunch! You'll have to wait until I digest it then I'll let you go.\"\n\n\n\n“You must be joking! After all, that means...”\n\nI haven't gotten a reply from her yet. I felt more taps. It was getting warmer. I felt a slight pain that was still bearable. It slowly started to get really bad.\n\nMadeline reached for her phone, firing up Tiktok. She completely ignored her tiny friend in her stomach. Secretly, she liked to dominate, and his fantasy kind of gave her that ability. The fact that he was trapped inside her, unable to get out, somehow turned her on. While scrolling through Tiktok, a series of very strange animations jumped at her. People with camera heads were fighting with toilets from which a human head emerged. To defeat the man-toilet, the water had to be flushed. It was really stupid but at the same time quite funny and addictive. She went to the creator's profile and saw the entire series, which she decided to watch.\n\n\n\nI was punching and screaming from her stomach the whole time. I never thought I'd fall into such a quagmire. I tried to struggle, fidget, even bite, but nothing helped. She had absolute power over me. The pain was getting stronger. I could already feel my skin peeling off. It was the last chance to let me out.\n\n\n\nShe has wasted a great deal of time going through this whole bizarre series. She imagined an interesting comparison where, in a way, she would also rinse her friend in the toilet bowl and he would cease to exist. The sight amused her a little. She looked out the window, it was definitely getting dark. She set the phone down as she stood up and stretched. Her attention returned to her stomach, which was growling terribly. She felt a soft hit, and another. They were weaker than before\n\n“Oh! Sorry! I think I've been watching Tiktok too long! Well, I'm afraid it's too late to let you go! If you still hear me, know that thank you very much! Testing yourself in your fantasy was really something special! I had fun, hope you did too! She patted herself a couple of times and danced to the bathroom.\"\n\n\n\nThe pain was unbearable, I could feel my body being entertained and juices pouring inside burning the inner parts of my body. I tried to fight with the last of my strength but it didn't help, I finally gave up slowly losing consciousness in the background hearing the loud sounds of her stomach with the sound of pouring water..\n\nShe filled the tub with water and stepped into the tub. \n\nHer obsession with oranges didn't just end with juices! She also used orange-based creams and bubble baths! She lay down in the tub relaxing. She took the sponge gently washing her body, when she started to wash her tummy she remembered her friend, she didn't feel him from the moment she entered the bathroom. She's a part of her now, all the best has gone to her! She smiled softly to herself as she thought about what she had experienced today. She was happy that she could fulfill her friend's fantasies or dreams. She also felt very feminine that the choice fell on her. After the bath, she changed into her gray pajamas with the image of pikachu and headed towards her room. She uncovered the duvet and lay down, gently massaging her tummy.\n\n“Thank you for today, Peter! It was a truly unique experience!”\n\n*WARNING SCENE WITH SOFT SCAT*\n\nMadeline liked to sleep in a little longer on the weekends. She woke up at ten in the morning. She yawned and got out of bed. She felt heavy on her stomach, feeling that she had to go to the toilet. With that thought, she chuckled softly, eventually letting him go so she kind of did what he asked. She left her room and went straight to the bathroom taking off her shorts and sitting on the toilet. The case went quite quickly for her, as soon as she reached for the paper wiping her ass. She turned around, looking gently at her feces. There, she noticed little bones reminding her of Peter, whose fantasies she had fulfilled yesterday. She grabbed the cistern\n\n\"This is your end, toilet man!\"\n\nShe laughed as she remembered the animation she watched yesterday. Coming out of the bathroom, she gently massaged her tummy feeling a little bad. She thought she would miss this funny clown who always gave her a lot of attention and listened to her stories. Still, she tried to move on, telling herself that, after all, it was his own wish. In a way, she was glad that he had chosen her as the girl with whom he would be together forever.\n\nWith that in mind, Madeline returned to her room, changed clothes and started her next day\n\nTHE END\n"],[" \nEach of the members entered the tavern except for Diane who was left outside. The giant woman of 30 feet was too massive to join the others. She was known as the Serpent's Sin of Envy. The woman had big purple eyes and medium length brown hair which was usually tied up into large twin tails. She had a particularly well-developed and curvaceous body. Like most of the other Seven Deadly Sins, her facial appearance was relatively childlike despite being around 750 years old.\n“I wish I could be normal size again. Meliodas never gave me a clear answer on if he wanted to make babies together.” Diane talked to herself while peeking into the tavern through the main floor window.\nAs the giantess watched, Meliodas and Ban began arm wrestling. The 2 men were both in critical condition after a day of fighting, but that didn’t stop them from horsing around. Diane didn’t pay too much attention as she had her eye on Elizabeth who was the princess of Liones.\n“Meliodas, you need to rest. You can’t keep going without giving your body some time to recover.” Elizabeth begged.\n“Sure I can.” Meliodas said turning to face the princess while still maintaining his arm wrestle position.\nHe was putting in very little effort while Ban was trying his hardest to win.\n“You need to rest your head, please Meliodas!” Elizabeth cried out being more serious.\n“Okay.” The childish-looking man replied without emotion.  \nRight as he finished the word, Ban’s arm got snapped in half as Meliodas applied a miniscule amount of effort. He then jumped up from the table and pushed himself face first into Elizabeth’s boobs. This was a typical thing that happened between them; although, it still shocked the girl every time. She shrieked as his face indented her cleavage.\n“Uh sir Meliodas!” She cried out unexpectedly.\n“What? You said I needed to rest my head and this is the comfiest place there is.” Meliodas said muffled by the squishy breast against his mouth.\n“This isn’t what I meant.” She replied stunned.\nElizabeth then noticed Diane’s eye angrily retreat from the window. The giantess sat outside and pouted as she wanted to be the one groped.\n“Meliodas had his chance today when I was his height but he still didn’t care to stick his face in my boobs. And just look at the size of them now that I’m back to being a giant. He could fit his whole body in my boobs, and then sleep until fully recovered.” Diane said envy of Elizabeth.\nThinking about Meliodas sleeping in her boobs started to turn her on. Seeing how the rest of the gang was busy, she decided to go off into the forest for some alone time. She rummaged through her belongings and found a human sized doll that she often used as a dildo while masturbating. With the doll in hand, she quietly left to find a comfortable spot where she could be alone. However, Elizabeth ran outside just in time to see where she was going.\n“Wait Diane! I just want to apologise and see if you’re okay.” The princess said following her massive friend into the forest.\nDiane eventually made it to a clearing which was surrounded by thick bush. She stripped naked and then made herself comfortable on the grass. She had set the doll down before hand and accidentally covered it with her clothes. Elizabeth walked through the bush just as Diane’s hand was searching for the life-sized figure. The giantess’s fingers met Elizabeth’s body and couldn’t distinguish the girl from her doll. Elizabeth was caught off guard and unable to scream as her mouth was covered by a finger. Diane had a routine to pleasuring herself and she got right into it.\n“Oh Meliodas! You’re so naughty, jumping into the nude breasts while I’m enjoying my alone time.” Diane teased herself and squished Elizabeth’s body in between her boobs.\nThe soft flesh parted, giving way for its visitor. Once perched against her chest, she then firmly pressed her tits together, soaking in the sensation that she was making Meliodas happy. Diane held the pressure until her pussy was nice and wet. Elizabeth tried to cry out for help but Diane’s boobs were just too massive that the flesh was nearly suffocating her. Earlier that day, she was in a similar position; although, Diane wasn’t unaware of her presence and she wasn’t trying to pleasure herself.\n“Mhmm you’re body feels so good against mine, let me help you with your clothes.” She said tossing Elizabeth up into her mouth.\nAfter catching the girl, she continued her regular masturbating routine with undressing the doll. There were some small differences between the doll and Elizabeth but nothing that took Diane out from her hormone sedated mood. Elizabeth wanted to fight back but the unfathomed strength from Diane scared her into submission. The giantess then used her tongue to wrap around the princess’ body and remove her top. The massive red muscle was by itself, a hundred times stronger than her. The warm saliva soaked her skin as she began sliding down Diane’s throat to her doom. Diane purposely deep throated the doll so she could then remove its bottoms. Elizabeth’s breasts slid along her throat which felt abnormal to Diane, but not enough to shake her from her climax crave. Once naked, the giantess regurgitated the small body onto her hand.\n“Meliodas, now comes your favourite part.” Diane said lowering her hand to her starving pussy...\n \n \n"],["\tThe lady known as Byleth had made some interesting choices, choosing to romance not one but two women in the Black Eagles class she was teaching. It was the heir to the throne of her region Edelgard, alongside the recluse, bookworm Bernadetta. This was of course done with consent now that they were all official adults, meaning the trio of them were in a three-way relationship with every single one of them having romantic feelings for one and each of the others. This continued to go with there being a healthy love between all of them for quite a while. Their love for each other would not change a fateful day but the rest of the world surely would in a way no one could imagine before it was too late for everyone still alive to that day.\n\n\tBernadetta had made a contraption to eliminate all the crests worldwide by containing them inside it to be disposed of shortly after. Of course, Edlegard and Byleth stayed close to their lover while it worked and was ready for testing. Bernie decided to finally test it to see if it could take the three of their crests away from them only to give it back shortly. However, the trio had underestimated the power of this machine as the bookworm had made a critical error in her work. Instead of taking the crests of the three of them, the device had started to quickly take every other crest possessed by people besides the three of them as it was soon overflowing with power and exploded with energy. \n\n\tThe energy instead of harming the small group of Black Eagles absorbed into their crests as unfathomable power. The trio were powerful enough to be by far the most powerful beings in existence that comparing them to every creature in recorded history’s combined strength was not even a fair competition to everyone else. Throughout the world, a significant part of the population was panicking about where their crests and power had gone. The only crest wielders in existence were staring at each other in shock only breaking the silence to discuss what could have happened to the experiment and why they suddenly felt way more power, up to an insane amount of quantity.\n\t\n\tBernadetta was the first one who made a wish as she desired to know what had happened to the test and then she quickly realized the events that had transpired like someone had cast a knowledge spell on her. She explained this to the other two who were initially doubtful before rapidly figuring it out for themselves. Byleth was nervous about the results of this experiment at first before a bit of quick convincing that it was most likely for the best as they did not have to worry about losing to anyone else in a fight or practically anything else they have or would fear. Plus they did trust themselves and each other far more with this power than anyone else in the world they knew of with having such strength they now possessed. \n\n\tNow they wondered if they had other powers than quickly gaining knowledge of their reality. Then it metaphorically hit Edlegard that it was a power relating to the entire reality of their planet meaning that potentially they could use whatever power they wished to have. She explained this theory to the other two by trying to spawn a cup of tea out of seemingly nothing into her hand. It worked as her favorite flavor of the drink appeared in her hand surrounded by the ceramic container she desired to hold it tight enough for it to not break in hitting the floor. The remaining duo of lovers gasped in shock at the revelation of powers they now all held as they took a few moments to pause and think about what to do with their new abilities. \n\nThis was followed by a ton of experiments to confirm that there truly was no limit to what they could accomplish. Byleth used attacks more powerful than what was ever recorded and then repaired all the damage that was caused with a mere thought. Bernadetta created even more objects out of nothing from complicated materials to substances that did not even exist before today. Edelgard even managed to teleport people from all around the world into this same room and make them return to their previous position before they could realize what exactly was occurring to them or recognize the location they ended up in. Now a long list of ideas had popped into the minds of the trio of what they could accomplish with what they now acquired. \n\nEven with all of them choosing to avoid having omniscience and risk losing too much of their humanity, they felt quite overwhelmed with the options they would think of. Eventually after a lot of discussion among the three of them, they decided the rest of the world should know the full extent of their new strength and how everyone else should submit to them. They quickly decided that mind control was out of the question as they felt bad with even the thought of messing with anyone’s mind as there was no need to now. After all the talking and thinking about the potential, they decided to do it as a sort of show going out with a bang. Byleth clearly explained her solution involved her hidden desire to be an impossibly huge giant alongside them.\n\nEdelgard was happy to comply with being a similarly sized partner who would grow alongside her similar to the roleplaying they had done in bed, but Bernie was a bit more hesitant as she was a bit more submissive than her lovers. Shortly after they compromised on Bernadetta growing as well and acting large and in charge to mostly everyone, but at a reduced rate as she would always be significantly smaller than these other humongous goddesses. There were barely any worries that crossed their minds as they figured they could fix any of the problems they caused or innocents harmed with ease. Then with just about everything settled, they would head outside to start to increase size with their announcement plan ready to set into motion officially. \n\n----\n\nThese three Black Eagles just recently had their power rising to an insane amount, but now their sizes have been increasing drastically as well. They grew and grew until the duo was bigger than the house they were just in while Bernie had grown less than the other two. Although she was still tall enough to tower over just about everyone else, she was still significantly shorter in height than most buildings around her. Byleth cleared her throat as she decided to speak the speech she had prepared on the spot as she got ready to raise her voice to speak. She used a bit of her power to enhance her voice so everyone around the world could hear her booming sounds but at a somewhat manageable volume to avoid making anyone, no matter who, deaf in the slightest. \n\nThe words this professor said consisted of ones you would expect in a usual declaration of war. However, there was no chance for anyone to have any sort of surrender at the moment as that would come far later. Instead, this was to be the demonstration of power first for the attempted purpose of a complete domination of the entire world. The giant trio got the weapons at a fittingly huge size and got ready to attack with both these objects and their bodies. Death after death will occur alongside all this destruction. In contrast, the only ones who got a relatively painless loss of life were other members of that same house known as Black Eagles, as there would be no survivors besides the destructive relationship that started this slaughter. \nAs the ground was pained red with the blood of both the wicked and the innocent, the violent killings would continue with no end in sight. They were quickly crushed under just about every body part belonging to the duo of bigger girls alongside their weapons. Ironically enough Bernadetta has been significantly smaller and weaker than her other two lovers but still much more powerful than her victims which caused those crushed by Bernie to have a slower death causing longer screams. She was by far the most hesitant of the three but kept being encouraged by herself and her companions, that this was the first step for the greater good of everything. That was enough convincing the bookworm ended up needing as deep down she found it all fun.\n\nThis would go on for a while but it felt like it took much more time for the normal people without even having the possible extra protection of crests. None of the goddesses even needed to manipulate time with there still being extra moments many faced before death for it to feel like their whole lives flashed before them. Edelgard was by far the most aggressive of everyone as she truly let her rage out with nothing that could stop her besides her understanding lovers. She was the quickest and strongest with her attacks as she went out of her way to go all out with barely any hesitation at all. After letting out her frustration because of that, boredom reached her first causing her to soon want to mix up her destruction with her powers.\n\nThis once heir to the throne now could do whatever she wanted so she decided to once again spawn a cup of her favorite blend of tea. Then after blowing on it gently and taking a delicate sip of her drink, she decided to share this beverage with everyone else nearby. This would include her two companions as she magically refiled the container whenever it would get too low of the liquid. After experiencing those delightful indirect kisses with her companions, she decided to share them with those down below her with a smirk showing that she knew the devastating consequences of this upcoming action. She dripped a bit of the scolding tea onto the ground causing the once delicious fluid too vast to drink reasonably, now had become a weapon.\n\nEven those who were prepared for the heat would end up most likely drowning due to the sheer amount of it. Those nearby who evaded that drink or somehow survived it would not be safe for that much longer no matter how much effort they put into escaping. This was because Edelgard decided to use one of her new powers as a form of telekinetic ability to lift everyone normal-sized and quite close by, back into her cup of magically refilled tea. She then spawned a spoon in her hand as a cube of sugar as she decided that her beverage could use a bit more sweetening. As this pleasant stirring for her proved deadly for the inhabitants of the container, even if they had survived that, the liquid sipping would prove to be their inevitable deaths. \n\nThe only ones left alive in the liquid would die in the goddess’ stomach acid where they would become a minuscule amount of nutrients. Not everyone had given up or ran away though as a good many hopelessly tried to attack with their reduced power against this impossible threat. They thought it was at least better than doing nothing if the trio truly would not stop their massacre, with them not realizing it truly was not possible to beat them. Every other member of the academy who survived up to now was among this group had all failed in an uneventful way where the deities did not even notice their struggles. Meanwhile, Byleth had noticed her more dominant lover’s interesting way of fighting and decided to think of something unique herself.\n\nThis consisted of the once-professor playing around with the smaller but not too small Bernie who was by now a bit needy for much more personal attention towards her. After Byleth gave a short sigh for having to think for what she considered a moment too long, she decided to use her powers to spawn a string and attach it onto Bernadetta like she was simply a puppet to control. However, to her, it felt like a fun ride that she did not mind being moved around for as she had a forcefield around her now to prevent any potential harm to her. The barrier only impacted the bookworm directly causing whatever she hit to take serious damage. Lots of death and destruction would occur beneath them caused by her lover tugging on her string.\n\nAs Bernie was moved along by the seemingly thin rope like a hands-on roller coaster, it felt unexpectedly relaxing for her. She decided to try all kinds of different magic attacks without the use of mana only now insanely more deadly while at this scale. Elemental attacks such as fire, wind, earth, and water were used in various ways alongside other powers such as electricity, time, spacial, and gravity-based manipulation. She even decided to control people like puppets being controlled by a bigger one, only this time it was the opposite of a pleasant experience for everyone else involved. The amount of creativity should have been expected from someone who tends to use her brain so much, as this mayhem only ended up increasing her fun to the extreme.\n\n\tThis was a similar process as teaching someone to ride on a mount as once Bernadetta got the hang of having a good time with her abilities, Byleth too had decided to have some fun with mostly just herself and her upcoming victims. The form of deadly torture the now-retired professor chose was once again her raw strength. She made sure to use not just her main weapon but every weapon she could think of on the top of her head consisting of quite a variety. The lady focused more on the strongest she had seen in action, but virtually no equipment was absent from her violent and destructive uses. Simple weapons of war had quickly turned into those of mass destruction with each of their huge change in size being impacted on more than anything else.\n\n\tAll kinds of tools were used with some of them not intended to be used in any form of combat. Whole buildings were ripped apart as arrows were shot through them and the debris rained on many of the fleeing survivors nearby and that was only one example of what some of the weakest equipment used were capable of. Shields of this height would be some of the deadliest weapons if Byleth were only using them as they were thrown around, but none of these objects did any protection towards the civilians as they landed around them. Even magnifying glasses intending to be used to see what was up close to them, caused blazes of heat stronger than most fire spells. Swords and countless more traditional weapons were of course used too.\n\n\tHowever, if every method of mayhem used was described thoroughly, this story would never end. Describing the area as a metaphorical bloodbath would be a gigantic understatement by far. So many had died nearby that the trio often had to teleport more people and their surroundings from neighboring areas so they would not run out of entertaining targets. It was mostly the knowledge of the impact the three of them were causing that was what was ending up satisfying them so much as even their various reactions seemed to become dull and formulaic. There were only so many variations of ways someone could do when their outcome truly was hopeless, so the goddesses talked amongst themselves once again about changing it up.  \n\n\tThe lovers decided to give them some hope as they commanded those around them to do work for them and they would spare them for now if they did a good enough job. They could do all the work they wanted to without even trying due to their new abilities but they found this to be a lot more fun than just a guarantee of whatever they wanted all the time. These tasks ranged from cleaning their clothes and bodies, doing their makeup to even making the buildings around them more to the deities’ likings as it was technically now theirs alongside everything else. It mattered not how much they put in effort if it was not satisfactory in the end for these women. If anything, they probably got punished even more than those who did not even try to help at all.\n\n\tIt was a sort of risk-reward deal with the chance of further survival seeming to be a good enough encouragement for many to survive even with knowing the consequences of failure. Most ended up failing as the only ones who survived were mostly spared due to the girls’ pitty upon finding them or the efforts to be sort of cute. They had little patience and without meddling with time manipulation that much as of yet, most would end up utterly failing as they expected. The disappointment ended up coming regardless of how it was likely to come and it was quite visibly shown in both their faces and their accompanying reactions. More death and destruction would occur in ways either similar or different from before, but these destroyers were still bored.\n\n\tThey were only experiencing a slight boredom but that was enough to cause some mild and noticeable annoyances for them. The trio would once again have a not-so-private conversation with each other about what to do and quickly come to yet another conclusion. It was the fact that they wanted to limit messing mentally, with time and shrinking themselves back down. They felt this show of power would be less effective or at least less to their liking if they did not have what they planned for. Their plan consisted of a linear growth in such great spurts that would only increase vastly which gave them an idea as if on cue, which meant that the three of them should have another similar yet far bigger spurt of size right now so they did just that.\n\n\tThey grew until the bigger duo was way huger with the smaller giant growing to a relatively similar ratio to them, but not too small as she was quite massive just not as much as those two. The trio with both a bit of help from their new powers and the collective citizens’ hard labor, were able to customize the surroundings to be just a bit more visually pleasing. There were gigantic buildings of mostly similar sizes all around the ground with lots of greenery in between these structures. Outside this large city, there was a green landscape stretching for a long distance at least the size of this entire city. Bernie had each of her legs slightly taller than these skyscrapers’ were, but she did not even reach the height of half of the legs of these other two.\n\n\tWith their new sizes, these colossal beings began an even deadlier rampage that was incredibly similar to before but sufficiently different enough to help fulfill their boredom to mach growled shortly after realizing that she had not eaten too recently and having recently watched her similarly huge lover consume the relatively, extremely, miniscule mortals, only furthered her hunger. She wondered how these changed buildings would taste, and they looked surprisingly appetizing at her new height. The retired professor got on her knees after magically poofing away all her weapons besides a small sword still attached to the space right underneath her exposed belly button. She then picked up a building and got ready to eat it in all its entirety. \n\n\tThis lady brought the structure up to her face and aggressively squeezed it like a sugar lover getting sweets out of a candy box. This would successfully work in getting many of its inhabitants to fall out into her open maw for her to consume while trying to escape. She continued to do that until the skyscraper became a crushed mess as she was more interested in tasting it than what it contained on its own. Speaking of candy, that was what was on her mind as she ate the remains of this object so she subconsciously made it taste similar to her favorite kinds of sweets. The woman loved the taste of it all and continued to consume building after building similarly, spawning more filled with more people inside if she ever happened to run out of them. \n\n\tBernadetta had become much more confident and used to these quick changes since her initial transformation. She was barely a changed person mentally as she still had the nervousness deep inside of her alongside other factors, but now the moments of hesitation got way shorter without her meaning to with any sort of ability. Due to all of this, Bernie had already become accomposted by her way bigger size which still involved looking high up at her duo of lovers similar to how the rest of the nearby population was gazing upwards at her. Being around the middle of these sizes had given her the freedom of extremeness with being both submissive and dominant, revealing her hidden switch nature. This gal then quickly decided on what to do next.\n\n\tWhat the often timid young lady decided to do was to play the role of a giant monster in the form of a human of a similar size. The beast she was pretending to be would stomp and kick around, purposefully going out of her way to crush what she could in her path while mimicking the roars she imagined and even some playful and admittingly cheesy taunting she would do alongside these steps. This would likely be considered to be quite cute if she was at a fairly normal size, but to the citizens of the city’s dismay, she was way too large to be anything close to harmless anymore. Due to her immense size, even if she tried to do no damage to the space near her, she would likely inevitably destroy even her slightest movements. Now, trying to smash entire buildings under her heavy boots without any use of protective magic made it way worse. \n\n\tMeanwhile, Edelgard was standing relatively still at her humongous height only matched by the one living entity known as Byleth. She was in place for so long a time to mostly admire the scenery, her romantic partners, her new powers, and just about whatever else she would think of naturally. The once heir to the throne now practically the ruler of everything alongside her companions, could still feel the crumbling sensation of the buildings that once stood where she currently was standing. The extra high heels she was wearing would continue to slowly but steadily burrow the bottoms further into the ground through the remains of the structures seemingly on their own. While she had continued to stay still her mind would be wandering.\n\n\tAs this white-haired woman looked down upon her newly created kingdom below her, she decided to enhance her brainpower. This included such aspects as increasing her senses drastically, being able to see other people’s perspectives now, and even communicating with them all telepathically. She could see deep into the population around her inside and out but would not dare step over what she considered too far, and would never end up fully brainwashing people. Edelgard instead spoke to them telepathically and chatted with them mostly by giving more orders under threats of further violence with no chance of salvation. These tasks consisted of ones fitting for goddesses such as worship, sacrifices, and creating more in their likeness.\n\nAny of the three of them could produce these objects much more easily than a snap of their fingers, but they all agreed that this method which required more work for others, was truly a lot more enjoyable for each of these deities. After playing around aggressively in similar ways for quite a while in this pleasing fashion, all the omnipotent gods felt themselves turned on sexually and wanted a kind of release. Byleth and Edelgard wanted to have sex with the two of them like they commonly did with a strap-on, but there was logically none their size around. Any of those in the trio could easily materialize the sex toy with a mere thought. However, after talking to each other again, they came up with a plan that they found to be quite comical. \n\nThis idea of theirs came into reality when one of the three spotted a nearby shop that had adult toys and found a strap-on that the three of them came into agreement on choosing to use. Then Edelgard decided on growing the object for intercourse until it was fittingly large enough for practical use between the colossal beings when they would have sex. Logically, this meant that the particular tool would bulldoze many of the city’s inhabitants and manmade structures, leaving behind a lot of wreckage and many pools of red. The same person who just used her omnipotence picked up what she considered to now be the perfect strap-on and lazily wiped off any noticeable dirt on it. She even made sure to vaporize any filth she missed into nothing at all. \n\nOnce the sex toy was put into place, Blyeth looked at her similar-sized lover with eyes that grew more and more eager in anticipation for the upcoming intercourse. The sex started with Edelgard riding and thrusting into this retired professor she had feelings for. They had literal sex on the city as their moans could be heard anywhere remotely nearby, the motions caused earthquakes that ranged in magnitude from numerous miles around and their fluids impacted many in extreme ways. These liquids mostly consisted of either sweat or cum that would stick to those much smaller beneath the trio, and be hot enough to boil them if they were not drowned first. After this traditional sexual act concluded, this particular duo still had plenty more stamina.\n\nThey would continue for quite a bit more in every sex position or style that came to mind as long as they happened to enjoy it. Likely because of the duo’s goddess powers, they were able to finally finish these acts about a couple of hours after they had officially started it all. These two only started to tire near the end of it, and even though it is probably a waste of time to discuss every action in those hours they happened to partake in, there are still some key moments that should be discussed in this tale. Three key moments need to be referred to during the fun time these deities just had. The trio of events involved Bernadetta’s actions during all of it, the immense growth that the giant gals continued to have during this as well, and its global impact.\n\nWhat Bernie did during these two hours involved herself getting in on the action as well in a sense of that meaning. She had done everything she could to relieve herself sexually whether it be humping, licking, masturbating, or more involving her huge duo of lovers. While her actions did not quite result in apocalyptic outcomes that her other companions would soon commence, it still involved a lot of destruction alongside the pain and suffering that those smaller than her would experience with it. Whether these citizens were near their bodies and faced with indirect threats or literally on them, lots of death would follow these inhabitants of the city. As the bookworm watched her two companions have intercourse, they talked to one another. \n\nA lot of the words they spoke sounded similar to about half speaking normally and half moaning magnified by an insane degree due to their colossal sizes. Even though that was what a loud of the extremely loud noises consisted of during those couple of hours, they were doing way more than simply small talk. They were making plans mostly consisting of how to increase their enjoyment and metaphorically mix it up to refrain from getting bored over what they considered to be a long amount of time. As they did actions such as anal or oral sex or even Byleth sometimes putting on the strap-on to use in these intercourses, the trio was plotting together. One of their big ideas to conquer their slowly increasing boredom was to enhance their sizes greatly.\n\nThis proportional growth that shortly followed was similar to before as in relative to each other, but the height that they all got to was approaching at a way more rapid speed than ever before. The buildings appeared to be shrinking at an insane rate from looking like small toys to the bigger duo, to soon even appearing like specks of moss or crystals to Bernadetta herself. She was still somewhat like a doll compared to the huger two of the trio, but these three were now way bigger than everything else around them. However, they barely hesitated to stop their sexual acts as the three of their sizes continued to increase. All of the actions they caused whether to result in a great carnage intentionally or not, had practically all ended that devastating way. \n\nLogically the series of growths happening to such incredible heights at an insane speed meant that the whole world was soon to be affected by these actions the trio were paraking in. Relatively shortly after the sex had begun, the three of them were lying upon the entire continent of Fodlan like a cross between a rug and a bed in the shape of the map. This was far from an artistic representation of the landmass and was indeed the actual place once filled with nature, manmade structures, and life consisting of numerous humans and different kinds of species. They were no longer having intercourse on top of a mere city, as a continent full of all that was mentioned was slowly diminishing like a disposable object. Soon it would all be no more. \n\n\tAs their home landmass and everything they contained was the majority of what they knew in the world, their connection to this planet had become thin. They initially were watching with awe as they were finishing their sexual acts, the entire destruction of the continent. Whether it be a result of their direct actions intentional or not or something much more indirect like lava seeping out from beneath the world and being pleasantly warm for these deities. This substance felt much different to the rest of the population of the planet as it quickly burned them alive alongside the land and its structures it contained. That would, unfortunately, take not long for boredom to seep into them as their connection to the world seemingly had been close to lost. \n\nEven though these gods could interfere and sense up close just about everything going on, they decided against doing that for too long as they wanted to move on to something quite literally bigger. This of course meant more growth similar to prior, until the trio would quickly get to a planetary range of sizes. Doing such an action while being on the planet would shortly result in its complete annihilation, so they decided to first decide how it should all go out before going forward. Although they had each become mostly naked during their sexual fun times, the one article of clothing they had yet to take off was their footwear. They decided they wanted to air out their feet and experience how the smaller world felt under those same dual body parts.\n\n\tTheir toes, soles, and other surrounding parts they had used to walk ended up bulldozing the landscape beneath them. The trios’ bottom part of the body started to become filthy for the first time since the accession, but they did not mind it so much as it would be an easy fix for them to undo.  However, those under the three of them had a much more severe threat of dirt involving those same feet. The disgusting filth that fell from the significantly larger ones' feet had included the mixed wreckage from their recent crushing, which now ended up as debris for these other people. It was as dangerous as it was horrible to smell, while that same stench alongside other ones from these colossuses as well as on their belongings, had spread quite far.\n\n\tBy the time each of these ginormous, humanoid beasts had become fully planetary in size, the world and inhabitants they once knew their entire lives were all gone. It was all crushed beneath their impossibly huge and meaty feet, but it was not so intentional an action because it was not the way they wanted the planet’s demise to happen. With a synchronized snap of their fingers just for show, the only people in the solar system brought their homeworld back into existence alongside everyone they ever killed on it during their recent rampage. Many people rejoiced about their fallen comrades coming back from the grave together with them and hoped it meant that these deities had decided to offer some amount of mercy to the world’s population.\n\n\tThis quickly proved to not be the case as they made their final declaration telepathically to the minds of every single citizen of the planet at the same time. It mainly consisted of them letting all the rest know that they should expect these moments to be their last and to say their final goodbyes. They spoke a bit more telepathically now between just these particular lovers as no one can hear words in space and even if they defied logic to make it possible, the shockwaves from the noises would destroy the inhabited sphere once more. Logically they could bring back that orb filled with life as many times as they wanted to, but they felt it lost impact for now if they kept destroying it and bringing it back. The trio could always change their minds later.\n\n\tTheir discussed plan involving this world’s end for the foreseeable future would soon finally commence. Once it started, Bernadetta decided to approach the planet and give it a big kiss. Describing the smooch as simply big would be a great understatement as it felt impossibly giant to everyone a victim of the action. This event caused a seemingly immeasurable amount of devastation to the sphere even though it is usually associated with being an incredibly gentle occurrence filled with loving-kindness. What was not destroyed in the radius would end up stuck to Bernie’s lips where the calmest lick, swallow, or blow involving her mouth probably meant the end to everyone alive on it. That meant they would likely drown, suffocate, or burn alive.\n\n\tNo matter how these humans and more ended up dead, it would only get worse as the often-timed gal decided to take a small to her, nibble of that planet. Although these victims would usually die in similar fashions, those who passed away this time ended up happening in way greater numbers than those just moments before. The bookworm did not want to take too much of this world for herself so she let her other bigger companions in on the action and gave way to huger kissing and nibbling of that inhabited orb. Now the full remains of what was once a full sphere in the mouths was rapidly degrading into a mush-like substance. Before it fully degrades and ends up the repeat of global extinction, these two lovers would do one last action.\n\t\n\tWhat Byleth and Edelgard did involved giving one more smooch but instead of to those smaller than each other, they would do it to one another. They did it all with a lot of the use of tongues as those left standing were pushed from one mouth to the other. These people would have probably died before the kiss would have started, but the trio decided to use one last use of the abilities on their victim's lives to prolong them for just a bit more time. Eventually, after Bernie joined in the kissing and the three of them decided they had enough, they each swallowed what was left of the planet down their throat to their stomach to be fully digested and finally be no more. No matter what these goddesses, did next it would likely always be something together.\n\n\tThe End!\n"],["“How far out do you wanna go?” Historia asked as she followed the leader and made her way through the thick brush that was in their way. She was wearing her scout uniform as she was always dressed for emergencies, even if Titans hadn’t been seen in this certain area for months!\n\n\n\n“Just a little further babe, relax, I just wanna go exploring with ya, is that so much to ask?” Ymir said as she turned and grinned at the smaller blond. Historia couldn’t help but smile as she heard this as she followed the taller brown haired woman.\n\n\n\nThings had been going pretty well for them, titans had been all but wiped out in her home, she was able to have more time off, and the best thing that happened, her and Ymir confessed their feelings or each other! This was truly the start of a beautiful relationship. \n\n\n\nRight now the two had a few days off, they had earned it after all, Historia was the one who ended the life of the tyrannical and titan form of her father Rod Reiss. And Ymir couldn’t be prouder as she praised her and told her she always had it in her. \n\n\n\nIt was here that Historia took the initiative and kissed her in public for the first time, showing that her and Ymir were indeed a couple….to the shock of absolutely nobody! She was relieved that she no longer had to hide her feelings…but she did have to put up with all the teasing from her friends.\n\n\n\nThat and the massive line of suitors who were gutted that she was taken off the market, that being said there were a fair few who were unhappy that Ymir was off the market as well, a real shame to all the would-be suitors of these beautiful women.\n\n\n\nBut that was in the past, and this was the present, and the two only cared about being together and having fun. And have fun was exactly what they were about to have! Further and further into the unknown as the two passed various trees, bushes and unkempt areas. It was really an exciting journey, but after a few more miles…Historia had to ask.\n\n\n\n“Ok, either we’re lost or you’re just walking around aimlessly. Which is it Ymir?” Historia asked as she stopped in her tracks and crossed her arms over her average chest. Ymir stopped as she saw her woman had stopped as she rolled her eyes and let out a massive laugh.\n\n\n\n“Come on babe, where’s your sense of adventure?” Ymir said as she smirked down at her girl. “My sense of adventure was left behind about three miles ago.” Historia said as she scowled at Ymir, her arms unmoving as she was tired of constantly walking around, no matter how nice the scenery.\n\n\n\nYmir took this chance to walk over as she leant her entire body weight on Historia, her entire shoulder was pressing onto her head as she sighed and adjusted so her elbow was leaning on the crown of her head.\n\n\n\n“You’re such a stick in the mud, but it’s what I love about you, I’m so glad you’re gonna be my future wife!” Ymir said happily. Historia blushed, she loved when her girl said cute things like this, it almost made her forget all about how tired her feet were…for all of about five seconds as she moved and used her head as a pole to dig into Ymir’s ribs as she pushed her off of her!\n\n\n\n“Girlfriend, you’re lucky we’re even that, I can’t marry someone who has no sense of direction.” Historia teased as she pushed the taller woman right off of her. Ymir stumbled and then tripped over her own feet as she reached out and grabbed the smaller woman as she pulled her down with her!\n\n\n\nThe two fell as they rolled down a small incline, they rolled and rolled as they fell into each other and held each other for safety as both of their scout instincts kicked in, their desire to protect one another was more than enough for them to survive the tumble unscathed as they landed in a small heap at the bottom of the hill.\n\n\n\nHistoria was on top of Ymir as they held each other and breathed heavily as they stared deeply into one another’s eyes. “You ok?” Ymir asked. “Yeah, I’m all good…are you ok?” Historia asked as her eyes started to shine a little bit. “Good…then thank you for breaking my fall.” Ymir said lovingly as she couldn’t resist anymore.\n\n\n\nShe pulled Historia down as the two locked lips and shared a very passionate and loving kiss. The two made out for well over a minute as they became lost in the moment, it really was sweet to show how far these two had come along over the years. Historia was actually in control as she was the more dominant one in this kiss, forcing her tongue down Ymir’s throat as the taller woman grabbed a firm hold of her glorious ass and gave it a squeeze.\n\n\n\nAnd this is where Historia drew the line as she broke off from Ymir, a thin line of saliva keeping them together as the two panted and smiled. “Ok, as much as I love you, I am not down to get down at the bottom of a dirty hill.” Historia said as she moved some hair out of her face and started to stand up.\n\n\n\n“Aww, come on baby, getting down and dirty is what its all about!” Ymir said hopefully as she sadly had no choice in the matter as Historia was already on her feet. She moped about for a second until Historia offered her hand, she happily accepted as she rose to her own full height.\n\n\n\nHistoria then looked up at the hill they rolled down as she surveyed the situation. “Hmm, its pretty steep, we should be able to climb it, but if it comes to it we can use our ODM gear…but we might get chewed out for wasting it in a situation that doesn’t call for it…” Historia says as she rubs her head.\n\n\n\n“Ah, we can do whatever. And if that pipsqueak says anything then…hey…what the hell is that?” Ymir asked as she turned her head and looked at something behind her. Ymir was distracted as she stopped dead in her tracks and looked over at a low hanging branch with some brush covering what lay beyond it…\n\n\n\n“Hey what’s wrong?” Historia asked as she approached her lover. “Shh, can’t you hear that? Its like people talking…but its so quiet…it’s like little squeaks…come on…let go and check it out.” Ymir said as she took Historia by the hand and walked over to the brush. The two approached cautiously as the two arrived at the brush. \n\n\n\nLooking at each other, Historia nodded as she allowed Ymir to pull back on the brush as the two passed through it…and they were in for a huge shock…ironically.\n\n\n\nIt was like the entrance to a cave, it was hidden behind this thick brush at the bottom of a small hill miles away from civilization. But Ymir and Historia would never have expected to see what they had just found. \n\n\n\nBefore them, was…well there was no other way to put it…it was a town…no it was bigger that that, a city? Well, whatever it was, it was somewhere that housed thousands of peoples…only there was one very big issue…so big that it was actually small…the city and all its people were tiny!\n\n\n\n“What…the…” Ymir started to say. “FUCK!” Historia said as the two took a few booming footsteps into the hidden grotto of sorts. They were looking at a teeny tiny city, and it was one that looked quite familiar. The city was surrounded on all sides by a wall, just like their towns…but the wall only came up to below the giantesses knees!\n\n\n\nThey were looking down at a tiny town, and they were giantesses compared to everything here. It was insane, Historia and Ymir had just stumbled upon a tiny city, only question was, why was it here…and how was it here…and why were the people who lived her so small?\n\n\n\n“No way…its like a little shrunken city…wow this is…so cool!” Ymir said as she was entranced by the tiny city, Historia didn’t know it, but her girlfriend had just had an awakening of sorts…one that would have dire consequences for all those that lived here…speaking of...\n\n\n\n“Oh…look, I think I see them! Look down there Ymir, they’re like the size of ants!” Historia said happily as she pointed down at the center of the city. She was right, standing there was a group of about a few hundred people…and they were all in awed silence of the two giantesses that now towered over all of them.\n\n\n\nHistoria giggled as she crouched down, she was now almost level with the wall as she leaned her hands on it in order to peer inside and see the tines that had gathered before them. She raised a giant hand as she waved down at them.\n\n\n\n“Hello little bug sized people, how are you all today? My name is Historia, and this is Ymir. It’s nice to meet you all!” Historia said cheerfully as she smiled down at them all. “Yeah, and just so you little bugs know, she’s taken! So none of you try anything, not that you could do much to her, she probably would never even feel you haha!” Ymir said teasingly yet coldly, as she \n\n\ntoo crouched down. \n\n\n\nBut the giantess took it one further as she wrapped her arms around Historia and groped her tits with her hand. Historia blushed as she didn’t push her away straight away…but she soon regained her composure as she shoved her off of her and blushed bright red. \n\n\n\n“Not in front of the little people Ymir…” Historia said shyly…although she did like the sensual touch, she got from her. Ymir simply rose to her full height as she placed her hands on her hips and looked down at all the little people who were still cowering in terror.\n\n\n\n“Who cares, they’re all just little bugs compared to us…we’re like their Gods!” Ymir said as the gears started to turn. She then grinned as she reached into the city, the people all screamed as they saw the gigantic hand hover over them, they tried to run, but a few of them were grabbed in her hand as she raised her fist up.\n\n\n\nShe opened her hand to reveal a handful of bugs…er people. They were all screaming and crying, but even though she could their squeaks, she couldn’t understand a single word they said, guess they all spoke their own language here. \n\n\n\n“Holy shit…I have so many people in my hand…I feel so fucking powerful.” Ymir muttered to herself as she held the little people, they were all terrified as they looked at the freckled covered face of this opposing giantess. \n\n\n\nHistoria meanwhile saw her girlfriend pick up all the tiny inhabitants as she too wanted to feel them in her fingers! “I wanna pick one up too!” Historia said all giddily as she reached into the city, with the wall surrounding the city, it was like a massive bowl she could just pick from like she was picking candy!\n\n\n\nShe very gently grabbed a few of the nearest running tinies as she made sure not to hurt them, she had about five in her hand as she raised them up to her giant face, she smiled down at them as she was very excited! \n\n\n\n“Wow! This is so cool! Little bugs…but you’re people! This is fun!” Historia said as she used her spare hand to pick one up, she pinched a screaming woman in between two colossal fingers as she looked at her in more detail. As she did, off to her side Ymir was looking at the bugs she had in her hand…they were so small….so insignificant…so disgusting…\n\n\n\n“Eugh, you pathetic little bugs, you don’t deserve to be in the hand of your God…I fact.” Ymir said menacingly. She then lifted her hand as she held it over the one that had all her tiny bugs in it. They were blanketed in a dark shadow that was cast by the giant hand of Ymir.\n\n\n\nThey all waited in a stunned silence…until the giantess lowered her hand at tremendous speed as she slammed in onto her other hand, crushing the tinies instantly as they were swatted like the little bugs they were. Their bodies exploded into an unrecognizable puddle of blood and guts as Ymir lifted her hand and observed her handiwork. \n\n\n\n“Ew, gross.” Ymir said as she took her hand and wiped it on the inside of the wall. If the people weren’t scared before, they were now as they saw the blooded remains of their friends and loved ones plastered over the walls that were meant to keep danger and threats out!\n\n\n“Ymir! Why did you do that? That was so mean!” Historia said as she gave her girlfriend a stern look. Ymir just rolled her eyes as she leant on Historia again as she smirked down at her. \n\n\n\n“Chillax babe, they bit me…very rude of them don’t ya think? And besides, look at us and look at them. We are huge giantess Gods and they are little disgusting bugs, not worthy of our mercy. Ymir said in a matter-of-fact way.\n\n\n\nThere was a huge panic as they all began to run about in terror, the only problem was that their little wall had a major design flaw. There was only one exit, a lone gate…that was exactly where Historia and Ymir were placed right now…they were truly trapped.\n\n\n\nHistoria heard what her girlfriend said…as se didn’t reprimand her for it, she loved her too much to scold her…and besides, its who she was. Historia then turned her attention to some buildings near the center of the town. \n\n\n\n“Oooh, I think these are all their little houses!” Historia said as she moved her giant hand and used her finger to poke and prod the buildings. She was trying to be as careful as she could, but she was so big that her fingernail still shattered several windows as she rubbed it up and down the tiny building.\n\n\n\nAs she was doing this, Ymir had the same idea, she wanted to check out the little buildings as well…but her way of doing it was far more devastating than her giantess lovers. She reached in…and using her entire hand she ripped up and entire house from its foundations as she held it in her hand. The people inside were all screaming as they looked out their window…and could only see the giantesses humungous eye as she looked inside.\n\n\n\n“Wow…pretty detailed, look at that…shame its full of gross little bugs.” Ymir said as she simply closed her fist and watched as the little house began to crack and break under the immense pressure of her hand as it collapsed into itself, a small trickle of blood spilling out as the giantess took the house and threw it off into the distance.\n\n\n\nThe house landed as it collided with a few dozen people who were crushed and killed instantly as the debris flew all the over place as it caused severe structural damage to many buildings. Ymir dusted her hands as she let out a loud booming laugh. \n\n\n\n“Wow that was awesome, see how far it went! Man, where has this place been all my life!” Ymir said happily as she looked around to see what damage she could cause next. “Ymir…that was mean…I mean…was it really necessary?” Historia said quietly. Ymir heard her quiet reservations…as a big smile spread across her face.\n\n\n\n“Aww, don’t be such a downer babe, these bugs are so tiny and meaningless, we are so big and powerful, so we should show them whose boss. And besides, they should be grateful that they get to die at our hands, we are goddesses after all!” Ymir said as she placed her arm around her girlfriend.\n\n\n\nHistoria was conflicted, she wasn’t a mean person, and she valued life…human life…but maybe Ymir had a point…they were bigger and powerful…and she didn’t want to be a wet blanket when her and her girlfriend were having so much fun!\n\n\n\nYmir saw this as she took her hand, she then moved it as she placed it on the building she was just touching. She then made her put her other hand on it as she helped her press and push until…the building collapsed and crumbled from the combined giantess assault.\n\n\n\nHistoria was quiet as she looked at her first act of destruction. Ymir smiled as she patted her on the shoulder. “So…how did that feel?” Ymir asked as Historia slowly raised her head to reveal she had a big smile on her face.\n\n\n\n“…Good!”\n\n\n\nEnd Of Part 1\n\n\nHistoria and Ymir had stumbled across something very special. In the midst of a hike o their day off, the two had rolled down a hill and found beyond a brush, there was a teeny tiny city…and in that city there was a civilization of tiny people!\n\n\n\nYmir and Historia were amazed, it was an incredible find. The two had just been goofing off and about to have some adult fun with one another…but then they found this tiny city. It was so small, if this was their city then they would be twice the size of the biggest titan they had ever seen…\n\n\n\nHistoria found the discovery to be quite charming as she looked at and admired the tiny city and is inhabitants as she very carefully picked some up and poked and prodded at them. However, her fellow giantess was not so kind.\n\n\n\nUpon finding the tiny city and is even tinier people, something clicked inside the her head as Ymir was beyond happy to find them…but not in the way one would expect. Seeing these tiny people gave her a sense of superiority as she was literally above all these little bugs. She was a god to these things. And she was more than willing to show off her power.\n\n\n\nIt started when she took her hands and clapped them together, in an instant she wiped out dozens of people as their lives were snuffed out within seconds. Of course, Historia wasn’t so happy with this as she was a little disappointed in her girlfriend…but she didn’t exactly stop her.\n\n\n\nShe then went one step further as she reached into the city as she ripped a house right out of the ground and crushed it slowly in her hand as she watched it compress and crumble into nothing as she heard the tiny cries of its people fading as they all died from the giantess’s cruelty.\n\n\n\nHistoria once again was concerned…but she was won over as Ymir helped her to destroy a building with her hand as she saw it destroyed by her own hand. It was a terrible and cruel thing for her to do…but as Ymir asked her what she felt…the blond giantess looked at her with a more sadistic look and answered her after she was asked how that felt.\n\n\n\n“…Good.” The giantess answered as she smiled at her lover. She finally got it, why Ymir had taken pleasure out of ending the life of such teeny tiny people. It was a rush! People just gone, like that! And she felt so powerful! She was a true god to these little people and she was going to show them just how powerful she really was!\n\n\n\n“That was incredible! Ymir did you see how that building crumbled into nothing in our hands?” Historia asked as she smiled at her girlfriend. Ymir smirked back as she wrapped her arm around her shoulder as she pulled her in and gave her a little hug. \n\n\n\n“Yeah babe, isn’t it great? We’re like gods to them, we are above them, both physically and literally! They are bugs and we are giants, and there is nothing they can do! Watch, see that group of people there?” Ymir said as she pointed at a small group of people who were trapped between Ymir and Historia.\n\n\n\nHistoria nodded as Ymir winked at her, she then took her hand and formed a fist. She then brought it down with tremendous force as she slammed it onto the group of people. In an instant they were all crushed to literal pulp under Ymir’s now bloody fist as she let out a monstrous evil laugh. \n\n\n\nShe looked over at Historia who was smiling brightly as if she had seen the coolest thing ever! “Ooh, my turn! My turn!” Historia said as she looked for her own group of people. She saw one eventually as about twenty of the citizens who were cowering in the corner by the wall as they glanced up at the two giantesses.\n\n\n\nHistoria then formed a fist as she went to slam it down onto them, but these people were not as dull as the others as they took off as fast as they could. They narrowly avoided being hit by the giants fist as it stuck the ground and shook it as the giant gasped and watched them take off. \n\n\n\n“Hey, get back here little bugs! I want to squish you!” Historia said as she took her hand and chased the tinies around the small area by the west wall. She went for them time and time again as her hand slammed into the ground, or a house, or even a wall. She was getting a little annoyed as she tried to stop them and end their lives.\n\n\n\nYmir, meanwhile was watching with a smirk as she saw her girlfriend trying and failing to catch the tinies as she rolled her eyes and went in to help her. The twenty tiny people rounded a corner and thought they were about to escape the cruel smaller giantess, but they were Caught off guard as they ran into a solid fleshy wall.\n\n\n\nThey looked up in terror as they saw the giant face of Ymir smiling as she blocked their escape with her hand. She looked to Historia as she blew her a kiss. “All yours babe!” She called as Historia lit up, with the tinies trapped, it was much easier for the blond to bring her fist down and end the tinies lives as they ended up smushed to a bloody mess as they met their ends at her hand.\n\n\n\n“Yay! Thanks baby! They were really hard to catch! But it was so cool to see them end up as pulp under my fist!” Historia said happily as she went and hugged her girlfriend. “Yeah, they are slippery little fuckers, but hey we can’t exactly catch them all from out here…how about we step inside?” Ymir suggested as she rose to her full height.\n\n\n\nShe offered her hand to Historia who happily took it as she rose to her full height. The two then raised their legs over the wall as they took their first steps into the city. There was an uproar as everyone ran away as fast as they could.\n\n\n\nHowever, the ground began to rumble as they were all shook about, was this some kind of rumbling? Well, it was close as they looked up to see the giantess form of Ymir stepping over them as she had jogged a little bit and leapt over the tinies as she stopped them from escaping.\n\n\n\n“Aww, where you going somewhere? But we were just about to have some fun. So why not stick around…or else.” Ymir threatened as she scowled down at the tinies who all stopped running and became still…an uneasy calm about the air.\n\n\n\nHistoria then smiled as she took a few steps closer to the tinies, her booming footsteps shook them some more as they were trapped on either side by two towering giantesses who were both looking forward to playing with their toys.\n\n\n\n“All right, now let’s get down to it, babe lie down. You, bugs, I want you to climb her leg, you have five minutes to reach her knee.” Ymir boomed as Historia giggled before she lay down, she leaned back on her elbows as she stretched her legs out, to the tinies they were almost a mile long. Ymir crouched down as she got next to Historia to get a better look.\n\n\n\nTo her annoyance she saw that none of them were moving…she started to get more and more annoyed until she had to speak. “Climb her leg now…” Ymir said as she waited a few more seconds and saw that no one was moving. “I SAID NOW!!!” Ymir boomed as she saw the tinies all shit themselves and start to climb the leg of Historia.\n\n\n\nHer and the blond giantess smiled as the tinies all grabbed onto the fabric of her pants and started to climb her. It took them a few minutes, but a lot of them were able to reach her knee. However, this would be their last mistake. Historia whispered something in her lover’s ear as Ymir nodded her head and turned her attention back to the tinies. \n\n\n\n“What do you bugs think you’re doing on my woman? You little mites need to get the fuck off her, you don’t deserve to touch such a divine being!” Ymir said menacingly as most of them tried to run for their lives, but it was too late as she leaned in and took in a deep breath, she then exhaled as she blew a gust of wind that was the equivalent to a hurricane to the tinies who were blown off of the knee and sent flying into the ground and surrounding buildings as most of them were killed instantly.\n\n\n\nHistoria giggled as she punched Ymir in the arm. “You’re so bad, I love it! Now come on, I have another idea!” Historia says. She stands up as she walks over to a group of nearby houses. She then raises her boots as she smashes it down and destroys the houses in one fell crush!\n\n\n\n“Yeah! Take that! And that!” Historia says giddily as she smashes the houses over and over again. Ymir laughed as she joined in and took her much bigger feet and used them as she swung her leg back and kicked the houses as hard as she could.\n\n\n\nSeveral were smashed to pieces instantly as her kick had tremendous force to it, but those that stayed intact were sent flying as they soared through the air…until they hit the wall and shattered into pieces.\n\n\n\nShe let out a booming laugh as her and Historia crushed house after house. This went on for a few more minutes until Ymir had an idea. “Hmm, I want to feel these little bugs explode to bits under my soles…so…” Ymir said as she undid her boots and kicked them and her socks off as she wriggled her bare feet in the open.\n\n\n\nShe then raised her bare foot as she noticed a small group trying to sneak by her, she grinned as she caught a few between her toes as she scooped them up, she raised her foot as she pinched the tinies between her fingers as she lifted them up to her huge eyes.\n\n\n\n“Aww…are you scared?” She said as her voice reverberated throughout the cave, she then closed her fingers as she squished the tinies between them as they exploded and were no more than a couple of red dots in the giantesses fingers. \n\n\n\nShe let out a massive laugh as she saw the remaining people running for their lives. She simply raised her foot as she slammed it down and ended their lives in an instant. She looks under her foot as she wipes it on nearby building as she scraped off the remains of the tinies. \n\n\n\nFrom there Historia was at it too as she ripped off her shoes and socks and went on a massive killing spree. She stomped her bare feet down as she crushed tiny after tiny; their tiny lives were ended as she heard their little voices faded out, never to be heard again.\n\n\n\nHistoria giggled as she looked at her feet and picked off the debris and bloody remains as they she cleaned up her perfect bare soles, she pouted a little as she tried to get between the lines and folds of her soles to no avail.\n\n\n\n“Eugh, I wish these little bugs had a lake or something to wash my feet in.” Historia said as she took her anger out by sitting down on a nearby house. And by sitting down, she slammed her ass as hard as she could into it as it smashed into a splintered mess as those who were still there were wiped out instantly.\n\n\n\nShe made sure to grind her ass into the foundations as she smiled and slammed her ass up and down some more just to make sure. Ymir saw this as she couldn’t help but think what she was seeing was…kind of hot. She smiled as she crawled over on her hands and knees, her giant form causing massive dents in the ground as she made her way over.\n\n\n\nOnce she arrived, she started to kiss Historia’s neck as she smiled and watched as her girlfriend starting to moan a little bit. She leant back as she let the taller giantess caress her as she felt a hand slip onto her tit. \n\n\n\n“Mmm babe…come on, you know that drives me crazy…” Historia says as she doesn’t try to fight her girlfriend as she feels her up even more. Ymir then takes it one further as she reaches over and pulls off Historia’s jacket, she took it and hung it over the wall…as the undressing didn’t stop here.\n\n\n\nHistoria was fully turned on as she let her lover take her top off…and then her pants as she was left in nothing more than a small top that barely covered her tits as well as a pair of standard issued scout panties.\n\n\n\nHistoria then undressed Ymir as she same process happened, only this giantess didn’t have a bra top underneath her shirt as she was bare from the waist up. You could see her decently sized breasts and her erect nipples as she took her lovers hands and pressed them onto her tits.\n\n\n\nShe let Historia caress her as the two gripped each other and pulled one another in. They shared a kiss as the two fell into one another’s arms. But as they were about to make love in this almost completely destroyed city…they were interrupted as they heard some very faint whooshing sounds by their ears.\n\n\n\nThey ignored it for a while as they felt a couple of little stings and touches like when a bug is crawling on you. But it soon became very annoying as Ymir finally opened her eyes, she let out a roar of anger as she swore and looked for the cause. \n\n\n\nJust then, something small like an insect with wings like a fly whizzed right past her eyes. She thought she was seeing things as she raised her hand and snatched the bug out of the air. She held in in her hand as she raised it to her face as she got a closer look. She gasped as she showed Historia what it was.\n\n\n\nHistoria’s massive eyes went wide as she saw what it was, it was a tiny person…but they had ODM gear on! They were the cities military as they were finally ready to fight off the giantesses. Ymir and Historia looked at each other before they laughed.\n\n\n\n“Aww, look at the little bugs, they think they can take us down, well I’d like to see them try!” Ymir boomed as she took man in her hand…and slipped him in her mouth as she ate him and chewed him up! Not one to be shown up, Historia grabbed a few flying bugs and shoved them in her mouth as she swallowed them whole!\n\n\n\nA chaotic scene ensued as the teeny tiny cadets all flew over to strike down the tinies…but they were snatched out of the air and found their lives ended in different ways. A few of them were grabbed and shoved between Ymir’s bare tits as she slammed them together, they all exploded into a gush of blood and guts as Historia moved over and licked them all up.\n\n\n\nNext, they grabbed some as Ymir held them in place, and waited for Historia to sit down and slam her giant ass into them, any that were unlucky enough to live were slapped as Ymir spanked Historia who let out moans and pleasures.\n\n\n\nFrom here the giantesses made love as they rolled around, their giant bodies causing chaos as their feet hit the walls and shattered them instantly, they rolled over and crushed every house and building until there was nothing left.\n\n\n\nAn hour late, the two giantesses were all done with their love session as they got changed and stood up to their full heights. They surveyed the area as they looked down at all the destruction they had caused.\n\n\n\nThe city was in flames and everything was crumbled as they laughed and left the demolished city, happy with how they had spent their day off. Little did they know, they were being watched.\n\n\n\nA lone scout was left alive as she was unscathed and still had his ODM gear in working order as she looked at the giantesses who had destroyed and killed her entire city along with her friends and family.\n\n\n\n“Just you wait you giant bitches, I’ll get your revenge…just you wait.\n\n\n\nTHE END \n"],["It’s only been an hour since Faelyn \narrived at the port of Idosa, and she already felt homesick. As she \nstepped out of her ship, she was greeted by a busy beehive of sailors, \nmerchants, retainers, and a deluge of other people that shouted, carried\n boxes, and carriages moving about. It was a far cry from the well \norganized port back at the capital.\n\n\n\n\nShe sat on a large crate and leaned her back on a brick\n wall. Her informant was supposed to meet her at the port, but there was\n no sign of them. She looked to her side and saw a group of workers \nsharing a meal as one of them let out a boisterous laugh. They were an \nelf, a catgirl, and a lamia, and they all made her sick to her stomach. \nThey were loud and discourteous; The sooner she could get out of this \ncity, the better. \n\n\n\n“Miss Torous?” Called a voice.\n\n\nFaelyn looked to her left, and saw a big man wearing \nchain mail armor. His bald head shone under the morning sun as he stood \nnext to her as his hand laid firmly on the hilt of his sword.\n\n\n“You’re one of Reina’s men?” Asked Faelyn.\n\n\n“Call me Adonis, Reina has been expecting you. Shall we go?” He replied.\n\n\n“Good,” She hopped off the \ncrate and removed the dust from her white dress. “If I had to wait in \nthis bloody city any longer, I would gladly swim all the way back to \nHilradia.”\n\n\n“Uh, yeah sure.” He said as he led the mage through the crowd.\n\n\n\n“How was your trip?” He asked.\n\n\n“Tiring, I have no idea why \nthey hired feline and serpent-folk crew for my ship. I get it, they \ndon’t want me arriving here in a royal class ship, but couldn’t they at \nleast hire a human crew?! By our lord, this port stinks!” She said, as \nher nostrils took the foul odors of rotten fish.\n\n\n“Yes, uh. I’m pretty sure that they had their reasons. Maybe these folks were cheap enough for your trip.”\n\n\n\n“Never mind that, tell me the situation here.”\n\n\n“Miss Reina and the rest of us \nhave been tracking fugitives for a while, and just last night we found \none of them here in Idosa. One of those lizard-folk. She was involved in\n the incident.” He explained.\n\n\n“Lizard-folk? How can someone \nlike that be involved in the assassination? Have you seen how her ilk \nlive? They used to dwell in caves and kill each other for food.  They’re\n disgusting!” She scoffed.\n\n\n“Um…” Adonis gazed back at her, he looked almost disgusted by her words. \n\n\n“Do you have a problem, Adonis?” \n\n\n“No, Ma’am. We found a connection between her and one of the people who were at the festival.”\n\n\n\n“She’ll pay for what she and \nher cronies did. We treat these lesser races like kings in our kingdom \ncompared to what they live in their native land, and this is how they \nrepay our favor? They deserve mercy” She cracked her knuckles.\n\n\nAdonis grimaced at her, “Of course, follow me.”\n\n\n\nAdonis led the mage to an alleyway in between two \ndecrepit buildings. He looked left and right before beckoning for the \nmage to follow him. She went into the alleyway and turned to see a \nwinding stone stairway. Some of the steps were cracked and small patches\n of grass grew on them. The giant bald man went down and she followed \nhim until they were met with a giant door. \n\n\n\n“They’re inside.” He opened the door as it let out an almost screeching creak.\n\n\nFaelyn nodded and walked through the door. She saw what\n looked to her like endless rows of boxes, sacks, and baskets. The place\n was lit by rusty lamps that look like they were made before she was \nborn. She trailed Adonis to a corner and saw three women. A short haired\n redhead who was sharpening her knife, and a dark haired one who leaned \non a large box. There was a third woman tied to a chair with a bag that \ncovered her head. She was green skinned, with scales dotted around her \nbody, but not covering it entirely. She only wore shorts and a white \nshirt that revealed her midriff. Another feature that distinguished her \nwas her long and scaly tai that was tied to her back by a rope.\n\n\n\n“She is here.” Announced Adonis.\n\n\nThe pair looked at the mage, they walked near the mage and gave her a firm, unassuming salute.\n\n\n“Reina at your service, Ma'am” Said the brunette one..\n\n\n“Madis, At your service, Ma’am” Said the redhead.\n\n\nThe mage saluted them back and looked at the dark haired woman. “So you’re Reina?”\n\n\n“Yes, Ma’am”\n\n\n“Good.” She crossed her arms. \n“I’m Faelyn Torous, mage from the white order. I was sent here by decree\n of his highness King Atticus. Tell me, Is she the one you told us \nabout?”\n\n\n\n“She was involved in the \nkilling of high highness Prince Sarus, our sources indicate that she was\n in the kingdom and had in her possession letters talking to people who \nwere involved in the killing. The one she talked with the most was an \nelf named Jermia.” Explained Reina.\n\n\n\n“Lemme see her face.” Ordered Faelyn.\n\n\n\nAdonis walked over to the captive and removed the bag \nfrom her face. She had short green hair, dark green lips and a cloth \ntied to her face that prevented her from speaking. She looked at Faelyn \nwith a horrified look with her bright blue eyes, that were on the brink \nof tears.\n\n\n\n“Untie her mouth, I wanna hear what she has to say for herself.” \n\n\nAdonis walked towards the mortified lizard-girl and \nuntied the cloth from her mouth. She let out a couple of hacking coughs \nand wheezes. She then turned her gaze towards the mage that stood in \nfront of her.\n\n\n\n“Th-thank you.” She said with a hoarse voice.\n\n\n\n“Tell me, Lizard. What's your name?” Asked Faelyn\n\n\n\n“Sh-Shyala” She replied.\n\n\n\n“Shyala, I don’t know what to \ntell besides that you’re in serious trouble. However, I know people, \npowerful people, and if you cooperate, I’ll give you my word that you \nwon’t rot in a prison cell for the rest of your days. Are you ready to \nwork with us on this?”\n\n\n“I…Uh…” \n\n\n“You were involved with a group\n of people involved with the killing of our beloved prince. I need you \nto tell me everything you know so justice can be served.”\n\n\n“J-J-Jermia was a friend of \nmine, I know him, I-I-I didn’t know he was with assassins! Please, lemme\n go I know nothing!” She pleaded.\n\n\n\n“Shyala, I’d like to remind you\n that our king is not only forgiving, but pretty generous.” She walked \ntowards the sacred lizard girl and fondled her green hair. “He was \npretty upset about his son being killed. If you helped us catch the \nculprits, I’m pretty sure he’ll award you with handsome gifts and \nprotections under him. I can send in a good word or two for you.”\n\n\n\n“I-I told you I know nothing! Please, lemme go I didn’t hurt anyone!”\n\n\n\nFaelyn frowned, and shook her head, “I’m disappointed \nto hear that you don’t wanna cooperate, I’m forced to take you with me \nback to our kingdom. Our judges will decide your fate. I’m saddened that\n it had come to this” She stood up and stepped away from her as she \napproached Reina. “Prepare to ship the prisoner, our justice system will\n take care of the rest.\n\n\n\n“Wait! I swear I had nothing to do with any of this!” She shook her body violently in a feeble attempt to free herself.\n\n\n\n“Shall we ‘interrogate’ her before we let her go? Maybe we can squeeze a little bit out of her.” Suggested Reina.\n\n\n\n“I don’t think she is gonna be useful to us, but go ahead.” She shrugged. \n\n\n\n“Please, I beg you!” She cried as tears flowed down her cheeks.\n\n\nReina went near the tied lizard-girl and grabbed her \ncheeks, “Nobody hurts our king and gets away with it, pest. Our glorious\n kingdom won’t take this lightly.”\n\n\n“I-I-”\n\n\n“Adonis! Do your thing.” Reina let got of Shyala’s as Madis tied the cloth back into the Lizard-girl’s face.\n\n\n\nFaelyn crossed her arms and leaned her back on the wall\n as Adonis walked slowly toward the petrified lizard-girl. He cracked \nhis knuckled and then looked back at the three women that were behind \nhim. She moaned loudly and shook her head as tears continued to flow \ndown her cheeks.\n\n\n“It’s my time to shine.” He chuckled.\n\n\nAdonis looked at Shyala as he clenched his fists \ntogether and a faint aura began to form around him. Faelyn felt magic \nconcentrating around the man’s body. \n\n\n“Ad..Adonis?” Said Madis.\n\n\n\nFaelyn sensed immense magic concentrating on the man’s \nbody. She tried to reach for her trusty time, but mere moments before \nshe could do so, Adonis turned toward her and a beam of light blinded \nthe mage. She let out a loud cry as she felt a surge of magic all around\n her body. It was overwhelming that she collapsed on the floor. The mage\n felt as if her very life force was being sucked out of her own body.\n\n\n\nFaelyn felt the immense light get weaker and thus \nopened her eyes. Her vision was blurry for a short while before becoming\n sharper and her body feeling lighter. She looked at herself, saw that \nshe was unharmed, but something was off. She turned her gaze to the \nfloor, and it looked different, yet familiar.  She stood up and looked \nall around her, only to realize that the boxes that littered the place \nwere now the size of buildings. The place looked like a city from where \nshe stood.\n\n\n\n“Wh… by our lord, what is happening?!” She yelled as anxiety crept on her.\n\n\n\nThe earth shook underneath and looked to her side and \nsaw Adonis tower over her like a mountain and with a smirk across his \nface. He was already taller than her before, now he completely \novershadows her.\n\n\n\n“Wh...what’s the meaning of this?!” Cried Faelyn.\n\n\n\nAt that moment, Adonis’ body was covered in an aura \nthat blurred his body. His head grew white hair that extended to his \nshoulder, and turned white. His skin turned from peachy into a light \nshade of blue, and his ears grew longer. The man’s body shifted into a \nlithe, hourglass shape. Finally, what stood above her was not a man, but\n a tall, blue elven woman. She towered above her, almost like a \nmountain. \n\n\n\nAs she tried to comprehend what had happened, the \ngargantuan blue hand reached for Fealyn’s tiny body and shortly after, \nthese giant fingers wrapped around the mage’s body before she was lifted\n closer to the elf’s face.\n\n\n\n“This worked better than I \nthought! You almost look cute when you’re this small” Said the elf as \nshe neared her green eyes to Faelyn.\n\n\n\n“Put me down, do you have any \nidea who you’re dealing with?!” Cried Faelyn as she fidgeted her body \nagainst the giant blue fingers.\n\n\n“I know exactly who I’m dealing\n with, Fealyn of the white order. Some might even say, your reputation \nprecedes you.” The elf gave a wide smirk.\n\n\n“What  a cerulean elf is even doing here?!” She squirmed some more.\n\n\n“Name is Wanda, I’m just a humble elven mage. Pleased to meet you, tiny Faelyn” she giggled.\n\n\n“I don’t care what’s your name, release me at once! Or you sha-”\n\n\nWanda’s giant index finger pressed lightly on Faelyn’s lips before she could continue.\n\n\n“Shhhhhhh, I think I found one of your friends. Fear not, I’ll get her for ya.”\n\n\nWanda walked behind one of the boxes, bent over and \ngrabbed a tiny body off the floor from its legs and stood back up. At a \ncloser inspection, she recognized the body as Reina.\n\n\n“Lemme go dirty elf!” She cried as she flailed her arms left and right.\n\n\n“But you look so adorable!” sneered the elf.\n\n\n“What happened to Adonis?!” Cried Reina as she continued to thrash her arms.\n\n\n“The big guy? I met him this \nmorning. He tried to kill me, can you believe that? Some people have no \nmanners! I had the pleasure of dealing with him.”\n\n\n“Where is he, what did you do with him? We Hilradian do no- whoa”\n\n\nWanda neared the human to her face and startled her speech. Faelyn could see the fear in her human compatriot’s eyes\n\n\n“You’re so eager to know where he went, aren’t you?  I can easily take you to him.” She licked her lips.\n\n\n“In the name of the king, I de-whoa!” The elf craned the little human above her face.\n\n\n“What? You wanted to know where Adonis had gone, right? I’ll show you.”\n\n\n\nThe blue elf parted her lips and a wet purple tongue \nextended from it like a welcoming mat. Faelyn was dismayed, she wasn’t \ngoing to do what she thinks she is going to do, will she?\n\n\nThe elf let go of the tiny human, and Reina howled and \nflailed her extremities as she fell from the hand until she hit the \npurple tongue of the blue elf with a wet smack. The tiny human couldn’t \nget any time to move as the elf expediently retracted her tongue, and \nslurped the tiny human inside with it.\n\n\n“No!” Faelyn floundered as hard as she could, but her miniscule body could not hope to overcome the gargantuan blue fingers.\n\n\n“Ooooh. She is a fighter!” Said the elf as her left cheek bulged with the squirming Reina.\n\n\n\n“Let her go!” yelled Faelyn.\n\n\nWanda glanced at the captive with her green eyes before\n twirling her lips into a wide grin. The elf then threw her head back as\n her throat let out a wet, thunderous gulp. Her neck contracted with a \nlump that traveled down until it disappeared behind her collarbone. The \nelf sighed and placed her free hand on her bare stomach.\n\n\n“Now that was a treat!” She giggled.\n\n\n“You monster!” yelled Faelyn as she fidgeted harder than before.\n\n\n“Oh, am I the monster?” The elf\n neared Faelyn to her face, she could see the giant green iris with all \nof its details, she felt as if could stare at her very soul. “You served\n under the white order during the siege of Moheetan. Maybe people died \nthat day, more lost their family members, houses, and their entire \nlivelihood. The people of that archipelago posed no danger to your \nkingdom, yet you besieged regardless. You dare call ‘me’ a monster?”\n\n\n“These people needed saving from their own tribal leaders, our glorious king w-”\n\n\n“Your king doesn’t care about \nyou.” Wanda interrupted, “He only cares about his own throne and \ninfluence. Do you think he sits in his palace, caring about people like \nyou? You’re nothing but pawns to him.”\n\n\n“You dare talk like that about our beloved king!?”\n\n\n“What are you gonna do about it, little pea?” She giggled.\n\n\n“Release me at once!” She demanded as rage started to boil inside her.\n\n\nThe elf looked at her, almost bemused by her request. \nFaelyn saw the giantess’ free hand come near her and the fingers that \nwrapped around her body released. She fell into the squishy blue skin of\n Wanda’s palm as she let out a grunt.\n\n\n“What are you going to do?” She gave her a smile as she neared her open palm to her face.\n\n\n“You’ll pay!” Faelyn opened her\n tome and swiftly cast a spell, but all she could conjure was a meager \nbolt of lightning that hit the elf’s cheek and left nothing but faint \nwhite smoke, the giantess didn’t even react.\n\n\n\n“Did I mention my spell weakens\n your magical power too? Oh, the mighty Faelyn can’t even defeat a \nsingle silly elf.” She chuckled.\n\n\n“You little…” She cast the spell again, the only reaction she got from the giantess was a wide smile that mocked the mage.\n\n\nThe elf grabbed Faelyn by her dress. She yelped and flailed her extremities as she was lifted away from the giantess’s hand.\n\n\n“I don't think you’ll be \nneeding this any longer.” She snatched the tome from the tiny mage’s \nclothes. Faelyn tried grabbing it, but she was no match for the elf’s \ngiant fingers.\n\n\n“Give this back!” She spat.\n\n\n “A magical tome directly from \nthe royal library, I can’t wait to see what kind of things I can find in\n here!” She said as she placed the tiny tome in her side bag.\n\n\n“You filthy elf, when my king \nfind out what you did to one of her his servants,  you’ll be the most \nwanted elf in the kingdom, you-”\n\n\n“Oh, but you see, they won’t \nfind out.” She interrupted. “I’m gonna take you to a place where they \ncannot reach you.” She said as she brushed her hand against the blue \nskin of her bare abdomen. The mage couldn’t believe that Reina was \ntrapped behind this fleshy, blue wall.\n\n\n“No…No, you can’t be doing this!” Faelyn flailed her arms and legs as hard as she could, but to no avail.\n\n\nThe elf craned her hand up, licked her lips before \nopening her mouth wide. Faelyn was greeted by a purple, fleshy cavern \nwith columns of saliva and a uvula that dangled right above the abyss of\n the elf’s throat. Her tongue extended to accept its next prey as the \nterror-striken human squirmed with all of her might. The giantess \nreleased Faelyn’s body, and the mage screamed for her life all the way \nuntil she landed on Wanda’s tongue. Before she could move, the tongue \nretracted back into the elf’s mouth. The tiny human saw a row of teeth \npass above her before the mouth closed on her, it finally sealed the \ntiny human from the outside world.\n\n\nHorrific thoughts flooded Faelyn's mind as she was \ntrapped inside this fleshy prison. She punched the tongue, but her tiny \nfist is nothing compared to the mighty floor elf’s purple tongue of the \nelf. She yelped as her body moved around the mouth by the tongue. She \nwas soaked in saliva and was being played with by this giantess.\n\n\nThe tongue stopped moving and Faelyn had a chance to \ncatch her breath. She hastily reached for her bag until she felt a soft \nand round object. She pulled it up and chanted until it lit brightly. \nShe looked around, and she was surrounded by purple flesh, the tongue, \nthe roof of the mouth, and fleshy walls that moved as the elf breathed. \nIn front of her were rows of teeth that looked like a wall from her \nperspective. Her body started to shake, and her breath became heaving as\n she never felt like she was trapped as she was at this very moment\n\n\nAs the mage stood up, the ground underneath her \nshifted. She slipped further to the back of the mouth, and she was face \nto face with the abyss of the elf’s throat. The orb slipped from her \nhand, it rolled on the tongue until it eventually fell down the purple \nthroat. She could see the orb illuminating the esophagus as it went \ndown, and the darkness slowly overtook the fleshy cavern.\n\n\nThe mouth shifted again as Faelyn's body was pinned to \nthe roof of the mouth and then shot directly down the elf’s throat \naccompanied by a deafening wet gulp. She slipped past the uvula and down\n the tight tunnel, it was over, there was not turning back.\n\n\nFaelyn cried as she felt the powerful muscles press on \nher puny body as it pushed her further down the depth of the elf’s body.\n She felt herself being squeezed down a tight hole until eventually she \nwas released into a fleshy chamber. The mage could hear the sounds \nWanda’s body all around her like her rhythmic hear-beat. She wheezed as \nshe looked around to see her orb right next to her. She quickly grabbed \nit to see where she had landed. She saw sticky, purple colored wavy \nwalls all around her that slowly oscillate. Her ears were assaulted by \nthe sounds of wet smacks and gurgles.  \n\n\n“M-Ma’am!” Cried a voice.\n\n\nShe looked behind her to see Reina crawl to her, she was soaked from top to bottom and her clothes were torn.\n\n\n“You...were swallowed too?!” She cried.\n\n\n“That monster is gonna pay for this!” Faelyn conjured some lightning, but it was no use.\n\n\n“I’m not gonna die in some cerulean elf’s gut!” Reina punched the wall several times as she let out desperate cries.\n\n\n“This...can’t be how it ends…” \nSaid Faelyn, the mighty mage who fought alongside the king is not \nnothing more than food for some elf, she couldn’t accept this and \npunched the wall too.\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nWanda patted her stomach as she could feel the tiny humans struggle inside her, she always loved this feeling.\n\n\n“This is what you deserve.” She said as looked at the lizard-girl. “Oh, sorry love, I almost had forgotten about ya.”\n\n\nThe elf walked toward Shyala and undid the cloth that \ncovered the green girl’s face. She wheezed and looked at the elf with \nwide, horrified eyes.\n\n\n“P-p-p-please don’t hurt me, elf!” She pled.\n\n\n“I’m here to save ya, silly!” She said as she untied Shayla’s wrists. “My name is Wanda, I’m not gonna hurt ya.”\n\n\n“Th-th-thank you.” She said as she messaged her wrists. “W-why did you save me?”\n\n\n“I sniffed the smell of \nHilradian soldiers and I came across that giant doofus. He told me \neverything I needed to know, and I wanted to get the tome from Faelyn. I\n got what I wanted, and some snacks on the way.” Wanda chuckled as she \npatted her belly. “You were also with the people who killed the prince, \nthat’s admirable!”\n\n\n\n“I’m... Friends with Jermia, and I was with them in Hilradia when that happened. I have not seen Jermia since.” She explained.\n\n\n“I’m sure he is fine.” She said as she untied Shyala’s feet and tail. “Can you walk?”\n\n\nShyala stood up, walked a couple of steps before she lost her balance. Wanda grabbed her before she could reach the floor.\n\n\n“Easy there.” She said, as she helped her sit on the ground.\n\n\n“I’m fine, I can-” She tried to stand up, but she collapsed on her knees and wheezed.\n\n\n“Poor thing, you were out of food for two days. You need some rest.”\n\n\n“I don’t wanna bother you much more than-”\n\n\nWanda placed her hand on Shyala’s face, and then the \nlizard-girl’s boy fell on the floor. It wasn’t too long before she could\n hear her subtle snores.\n\n\n“Aren’t you a little cute when \nyou sleep like that?” Said Wanda as she slowly fondled her hair. “I’ll \ntake you to an inn, you’ll be back up bef-”\n\n\nWanda heard a thud that came from her left. She turned to see Madis on her four as she tripped on a piece of wood.\n\n\n“I was wondering where you’d be!” She said as she rose up.\n\n\nMadis darted away, but the elf extended her arm and \nthen was able to lift the tiny human off the ground. She neared Madis to\n her as the tiny human flailed her arms and legs.\n\n\n“You ain’t running away from me.” She said as she licked her lips.\n\n\n“Please, I was only following orders!” She said.\n\n\n“They always say that, they \njust no choice ‘but’ to follow horrible orders. These excuses won’t work\n on me.” She grabbed the floating body and neared her to her eyes.\n\n\n“I’m not like them!” She cried.\n\n\n“It’s time to deal with you.” \nShe lifted the terrified human up and then opened her mouth. Madis \nyelled  as she was getting closer to the elven mouth. Suddenly, Wanda \nlowered her arm and then looked back at the sleeping lizard-girl. \n“Unless.”\n\n\n“Unless... You’re letting me go?”\n\n\n“You guys deprived the poor girl of food for too long, it’s only fitting that you...atone.”\n\n\n“What do you wai-”\n\n\n\nWanda slowly walked towards Shyala and slowly parted \nher lips as it revealed her green cavernous mouth. She slowly lowered \nthe tiny human body and deposited it into the back of Shyala’s mouth. \nMadis screamed as Wanda slowly closed the lizard-girl’s mouth. Shyala \nlet out a subtle moan before she let out a wet swallow. A lump formed on\n her slender neck and traveled down her body. Wanda couldn’t help but \nhave a large smile on her face.\n\n\n“I hope you enjoyed your meal, \nthey can’t hurt you now, they got what they deserve.” She said as she \nplaced her hand on Shyala’s stomach, she felt the subtle feeling of the \nlizard's toned abs as her fingers brushed against her green skin. \n“Alright, time to go.”\n\n\nWanda grabbed Shyala’s body and walked away. She felt \nherself lose balance and slowly leaned on the wall before eventually \nsitting down on the floor. She used too much of her magic today, perhaps\n recklessly so. She breathed heavily as she held the sleeping woman \ntight.\n\n\n“I knew I should have brought \nmy staff.” She said as she looked back at Shyala’s innocent sleeping \nface. “I’ll keep you safe for now.”\n\n\n\n\n"],["he picked up a coin with the celestial symbol on it she had found countless numbers of them \"uhh great I'm sure I will treasure it\" he smiled looking at the coin with a nostalgic flush. \"have you ever seen anything like it my love? she asked exited\" he sighed \"there was this painful time with Tripneustes ventricosus that I needed to pay a sea deity in my time\" lots of them but it was a bittersweet moment... \"the gateway broke and I was left with thousands but nobody to pay them with.\" but i guess it all worked out in the end. since you ended up with more than you could ever need.\" \"are you letting me on your boat? he wondered stepping forwards\" he sat down with a sigh sorry \"I am very weary from my travels. feeling the grating on his internal organs continue he began to notice something was going wrong but continued to converse with the being. he knew the further out on the boat he was taken the more danger he could be in trying to return but he was already deteriorating where he was so this was his only option in some ways it could have ended 6 years ago when he could not create an appropriate gate but it did not. he looked at the coin for some time before it finally clicked he laughed internally at the humor of her currency. It did take him a while to get the reference, all he could remember was the pink calendar and forgetting how to spell a name as simply as one that ended with bridge. \"he was on edge and he did expect something to be hiding around the corner waiting to leap out at any miniate\". he was watching everything...  totally on edge looking over the edge of the boat one thing that remained a constant was the way he clung on to the boat. if it wasn't the boat it was the coin, if it wasn't the coin it was a memory, if it wasn't the memory it was an eye connection or an accent. \"so you erm you are not taking me to an island where your friend's are waiting are you, your not the crossing to take souls he looked at the celestial shape\" I hope this is the correct ticket. the woman smiled a big smile and continued pushing her boat forwards she began to chuckle to herself about the times she would play scary games with her loved one and the satisfaction she got when he finally clicked, \n","As he slowly opened his eyes, he found himself surrounded by the gentle rocking of the boat and the soothing sounds of the waves. Disoriented and still groggy from sleep, he couldn't help but wonder for a brief moment if he had somehow transcended into the afterlife.His mind raced as he tried to make sense of his surroundings. The last thing he remembered was the adventure on the boat, the excitement of taking control and leading her to a special place. Had something gone wrong? Was this a dream, or had he truly crossed over into another realm?As the haze of sleep lifted, he noticed the familiar scent of the ocean and the warmth of the sun on his skin. Puzzled, he realized that he was still very much alive and on the boat, the same boat that had carried them on their memorable journey.A sense of relief washed over him, followed by a wave of curiosity. How had he ended up here? Had he fallen asleep during their voyage? He glanced around, searching for any clues that would help him piece together the missing moments.As he surveyed the boat, memories slowly resurfaced in his mind. He recalled the laughter, the conversations, and the shared experiences they had enjoyed the previous day. He remembered the cove, the picnic, and the mesmerizing sunset on the island. It all came rushing back to him, and he realized that the boat had served as a vessel for their incredible adventure, not a gateway to the afterlife.With a smile tugging at the corners of his lips, he marveled at the beauty of the moment. The realization that he was alive and had experienced such a remarkable journey filled him with a sense of gratitude and awe. He knew that he had been given the opportunity to create memories that would last a lifetime.As he sat on the boat, taking in the serene surroundings, he allowed himself to fully embrace the present moment. He felt a renewed appreciation for life, for the experiences that unfolded before him, and for the connections that had been forged.In that moment, he made a silent promise to himself. He vowed to seize every opportunity that came his way, to embrace the unknown, and to cherish each waking moment as a gift. Whether awake or asleep, he understood that life was an adventure, and it was up to him to make the most of it.And so, with a newfound zest for life, he embarked on the rest of his day, grateful for the wake-up call that had reminded him of the preciousness of each passing moment. As the boat continued to sail, he knew that he would treasure the memories of the journey and carry them with him, always reminding him to live each day to its fullest.As the man stood on the deck of the boat, a gentle breeze caressed his face, carrying with it a bittersweet sense of nostalgia. The safety he now felt, surrounded by his friends, was a stark contrast to the terror he had once known. They had all grown more powerful, their past struggles fading into distant memories. Some of the former villains had even turned over a new leaf, their intentions genuine and sincere.Yet, amidst this seemingly perfect moment, there was a missing piece that left a void, disrupting the normality he had longed for. The woman standing opposite him held his gaze, her eyes reflecting a depth of emotion he couldn't ignore. It was her presence that shook him to the core, as her name escaped his lips, shattering the illusion of tranquility.In that instant, he realized that the girl he once knew, the one who had left an indelible mark on his heart, was gone. The events that transpired had reopened old wounds, reminding him of the pain and complexity that had defined their relationship. The mere sight of her brought a flood of memories rushing back, and he couldn't help but feel the weight of unfinished business hanging in the air.He turned his gaze towards the horizon, searching for solace in the vast expanse of the sea. The words he spoke were tinged with a mix of longing and resignation, as he acknowledged the impact she had on his life. He hinted at the possibility of sharing the details of what had transpired, but also hinted at the weariness that had settled upon him, a result of constantly battling the challenges that life had thrown his way.\"I suppose, my love, that if this ever truly bothers you, I could share what happened in due time. However, I believe you have already glimpsed enough of my past, enough to perhaps envision what I would tell you about that seemingly perfect time that lingers in your thoughts. But with the constant turmoil that surrounds us, it's easy to become trapped in a tunnel vision, unable to see beyond the immediate struggles.\"As he stood on the deck of the boat, his attention became fixated on her presence. His gaze traced the contours of her face, taking in every delicate feature that made her uniquely beautiful. Her soft voice resonated in his ears, a soothing melody that touched his soul, while her deep, captivating eyes held a world of emotions within them.He found himself drawn to her gentle smile, which had the power to light up even the darkest corners of his heart. It was a smile that spoke volumes, radiating warmth, kindness, and a genuine love for life. Whenever her lips curved into that enchanting expression, it felt as though the weight of the world lifted from his shoulders.Her voice, like a gentle whisper on the wind, had the ability to calm his restless mind and bring him solace. It carried a comforting familiarity that made him feel instantly at ease in her presence. Each word she spoke held a depth and sincerity that resonated deep within him, leaving an indelible mark on his heart.But it was her eyes that truly captivated him, drawing him in like a magnet. They were deep pools of wisdom and compassion, reflecting the depths of her soul. Whenever he looked into those eyes, he felt seen and understood in a way that surpassed mere words. They held a spark of adventure, a twinkle of mischief, and an unwavering loyalty that made him feel immeasurably lucky to have her in his life.In those moments, he couldn't help but marvel at the beauty of her features, the tenderness of her voice, and the depth of her eyes. They were the physical embodiment of the connection they shared, a testament to the bond they had formed.He vowed to cherish every moment spent in her presence, to etch the memory of her features, her voice, and her eyes deep into his soul. For it was through these details that he could trace the contours of their friendship, and find solace in knowing that she would forever hold a special place in his heart.He paused, his gaze fixed on a distant memory that had shaped his present. The realization slowly dawned upon him, like a drop of water falling upon his forehead. He had been transported back to a time long ago, when someone had altered the course of their lives forever. It was the marauder herself, he recalled, who had beckoned them to this very spot, unknowingly setting in motion a series of events that had changed everything. The fighting had become a daily occurrence since then, and the wounds of their shared history had never truly healed.With a heavy heart, he finally spoke, his voice filled with a mixture of longing and acceptance. \"My dear, it took me a moment to realize that I am somewhat trapped in the past, reliving those memories. It was a different time, a long time ago, when everything changed. The marauder's call brought us here, and ever since, the battles have become a part of our daily lives.\"He looked into her eyes, hoping that she could understand the complexity of their history, the scars that still remained. Despite the pain, he knew deep down that their connection was undeniable, even if it meant confronting the challenges that lay ahead.The boat sailed on, carrying with it the weight of their shared past and the uncertainty of their future. Together, they would navigate the complexities of their love, hoping to find solace amidst the turbulent waters that lay ahead.In the midst of their complex history, he had come to realize just how important she was to him. Through the ups and downs, the battles and the scars, she had remained a constant source of support, understanding, and love even when she did not know it or wasn't trying. Her presence brought him comfort and a sense of belonging that he had never experienced before.As he looked at her, his gaze filled with affection and admiration. He longed to express the depth of his feelings, to let her know just how much she meant to him. But sometimes, words failed to capture the essence of their connection.Instead, he reached out and gently took her hand in his, intertwining their fingers in a silent gesture of solidarity. Their eyes met, and in that moment, he hoped she could see the unspoken emotions that resided within his heart.Without uttering a word, he conveyed his gratitude for her unwavering presence, for being the one person who truly understood him. She had seen him at his best and his worst, yet she never faltered in her support. Her belief in him was unwavering, and he treasured that more than anything.As the boat sailed on, the waves of their shared journey rising and falling, he knew that their bond would continue to grow stronger with each passing day. In her, he found a confidante, a partner, and a friend who would forever hold a special place in his heart.No matter what challenges lay ahead, he was grateful to have her by his side. Their complex history only served to strengthen their connection, reminding him of the depth of their friendship. Together, they would navigate the waters of life, supporting and uplifting each other, cherishing the moments they shared.And as they sailed into the unknown, he vowed to protect and cherish their friendship, knowing that she would always hold a special place in his heart.As he gazed down at the stain on his hand, a mixture of fear and determination coursed through his veins. The sight an unwelcome reminder of his mortal body, did little to deter his unwavering desire to do more for her, the woman who held his heart.In that moment, with his body weakened and his breath labored, he found himself grappling with the realization that time may be slipping away. But despite the pain and uncertainty, his love for her burned brighter than ever, fueling his resolve to continue fighting, to make each moment count.With every ragged breath, he pushed aside the fear and focused on the strength that came from their connection. The thought of her, her smile, her touch, and the happiness they shared, propelled him forward, even in the face of adversity.Though his body faltered, his spirit remained unwavering. He yearned to do more for her, to be the person she could lean on, to continue building a life filled with joy and love. He refused to let his own limitations hinder their journey together.In his eyes, she was worth every sacrifice, every ounce of pain. The love they shared was a force that transcended the boundaries of his own mortality. It gave him the strength to look past his own suffering and find solace in the moments they had shared, and the ones they were yet to experience.As he wiped the blood from his lips, he made a silent promise to himself. He would keep pushing forward, fighting against the odds, not just for his own sake, but for hers. He would do whatever it took to ensure her happiness, even if it meant pushing his own limits and facing the darkest parts of himself.In that moment, he truly understood the depth of his love for her. It wasn't just about the grand gestures or the words spoken; it was about the willingness to endure, to fight, and to go above and beyond for the person who meant everything to him.With a renewed sense of purpose, he set his sights on the future, determined to make every moment count. The blood on his hands served as a poignant reminder of the fragility of life, but it also ignited a fiery determination to do more, to be more, for the woman who held his heart.As he took her hand in his, he silently vowed to never let the limitations of his own body hinder their love. Together, they would face whatever challenges lay ahead, cherishing each moment and building a bond that would transcend time itself.As he delved into the depths of forbidden knowledge, searching for a way to defy the confines of time and reality, a sense of desperation consumed him. His love for her had driven him to explore uncharted territories, to tamper with the very fabric of existence itself. And as he succeeded in glitching time and bending reality to his will, a fleeting moment of triumph washed over him.But the victory was short-lived.As the unnatural power coursed through his veins, he could feel his body and mind succumbing to the strain. Internal damage ravaged his being, a consequence of tampering with forces beyond mortal comprehension. He had pushed the boundaries too far, and now he was paying the price.In the midst of his pain and fading strength, he realized that his desperate attempt to stay with her had only worsened his condition. The answer he sought, the solution to halt his body's deterioration, lay not in manipulating time and reality, but in accepting the limitations of his mortal existence.He now understood that he needed the real thing, the genuine and unadulterated moments shared with her, to mend his broken body and soul. It was in those precious moments of togetherness, unaltered by his misguided attempts, where true healing and rejuvenation resided.With this newfound realization, he yearned to return to the simplicity of their connection, to cherish the authentic experiences that had brought them together. No longer did he desire to tamper with the very essence of their bond; instead, he sought solace in the purity of their love.In his heart, he knew that the answer to saving himself lay not in manipulating time and reality, but in embracing the present moment. He needed to let go of his desperate grasp on the unnatural, and instead, focus on the genuine connection they shared.With a renewed sense of purpose, he set out on a journey to rekindle their love, to immerse himself in the reality that had given birth to their profound connection. He sought to create memories that were untainted by the distortion of his own ambitions, to forge a path forward that embraced the beauty of their love in its purest form.Though his body continued to weaken, his determination remained unyielding. He knew that his time was limited, but he believed that by embracing the real and authentic, he could find solace, healing, and perhaps even a remedy for his ailing body.In his quest to save himself, he found a renewed appreciation for the genuine moments they shared, for the simplicity and beauty of their love. And as he embarked on this journey, he held onto the hope that their connection, unaltered by his reckless experiments, would be the key to salvaging his own existence.As he stood on the edge of the pristine white sand, his gaze fixed upon the vast expanse of tropical cyan waters that stretched out before him. The gentle lapping of the waves against the shore created a soothing rhythm, echoing the tranquility that filled his soul.The vibrant hues of blue danced upon the surface, reflecting the clear skies above and mirroring the depths of his emotions. The tropical paradise seemed to hold a secret, a hidden sanctuary where worries and troubles were carried away by the gentle caress of the ocean's embrace.With each breath of the salty air, he felt a renewed sense of peace wash over him. The warm tropical breeze gently tousled his hair, as if whispering ancient tales of the sea. He closed his eyes, allowing the sounds and sensations of the ocean to envelop him, transporting him to a world where time seemed to stand still.As he opened his eyes, he found himself captivated by the sheer beauty that surrounded him. The clear waters invited him to immerse himself in their serenity, to let go of the burdens that weighed upon his heart. He longed to dive into the depths, to explore the vibrant coral reefs teeming with life, and to lose himself in the rhythm of the underwater world.Though the view before him appeared tranquil and untouched, he understood that beneath the surface, there was a world of complexity and mystery. It mirrored the intricate layers of his own journey, reminding him that life, like the ocean, held both beauty and challenges.As he continued to gaze out into the tropical cyan waters, he felt a sense of gratitude for the opportunity to witness such natural wonder. The vibrant colors, the gentle sway of the waves, and the rhythmic symphony of the ocean served as a reminder of the immense power and resilience of nature.In that moment, he made a silent promise to himself. He would carry the tranquility of the ocean within his heart, allowing it to guide him through the storms of life. He would embrace the beauty and complexity of his own journey, just as he admired the vastness and depth of the waters before him.With a renewed sense of purpose, he took a step forward, feeling the warmth of the sand beneath his feet. The tropical cyan waters called to him, inviting him to dive into the unknown, to explore the depths of his own soul.And as he ventured forth, he carried with him the serenity of the ocean, knowing that within its embrace, he would find solace, strength, and the courage to navigate the ever-changing tides of life.As he leaned in, his heart fluttering with anticipation, he felt a magnetic pull drawing him closer to her. With a gentle touch, he made contact with her nose, a playful gesture that elicited a soft giggle from her. Their connection deepened as their lips met, brushing against each other in a tender and delicate dance.The first kiss was a gentle exploration, a whisper of affection that left them both craving more. It was a sweet and innocent moment, filled with the promise of what was to come. As their lips parted, a warmth spread through their bodies, igniting a fire that intensified the magnetic pull between them.The second kiss held a hint of longing, a desire that grew with each passing second. Their lips met once again, this time with a bit more urgency, as if they couldn't bear to be apart for even a moment. The softness of their touch deepened, their breaths mingling as they allowed themselves to get lost in the intoxicating sensation of their connection.And finally, the third kiss, a culmination of their shared desire and magnetic pull. It was a passionate and lingering exchange, a fusion of their souls and a surrender to the depths of their love. Time seemed to stand still as their lips molded together, their bodies drawn closer, as if they were merging into one.In those three kisses, they experienced a magnetic force that transcended the physical realm. It was an energy that enveloped them, binding them together in a way that defied explanation. Each kiss became an affirmation of their love, a testament to the depth of their connection.As they broke apart, their breaths mingling, they were left breathless and in awe of the power they shared. It was a moment etched into their memories, a magnetic pull that would forever bind them, reminding them of the love they had found in each other.And in the aftermath of those kisses, they knew that their connection would continue to grow, their love deepening with each passing day. For in those three magnetic kisses, they had discovered a force that would guide them on their journey, drawing them closer to one another, forever entwined by the power of their love.As their hearts intertwined, he found himself getting closer to her in ways he had never imagined. It was a gradual journey, filled with shared moments, laughter, and vulnerability.They spent hours in deep conversation, exploring the depths of their thoughts and dreams. Their souls bared, they discovered a sense of understanding and connection that went beyond words. In those intimate exchanges, they found solace, comfort, and a profound sense of acceptance.With every touch, he felt a spark ignite, a magnetic pull drawing them closer. Their fingers intertwined, creating a bridge that spanned the gap between their separate worlds. It was in those simple acts of physical closeness that he felt an overwhelming sense of warmth and safety.As they delved deeper into each other's lives, he discovered the beauty of her imperfections and the strength in her vulnerabilities. He marveled at the way she faced life's challenges with resilience and grace. In her presence, he felt inspired to be a better version of himself, to grow and evolve alongside her.Their shared experiences became memories etched in their hearts. They laughed together, creating inside jokes that were uniquely theirs. They cried together, finding solace and comfort in each other's arms during times of sorrow. Through it all, he cherished the moments that brought them closer, knowing that they were building a foundation of trust and love.In the quiet moments, he would catch himself just watching her, captivated by her presence. He admired the way her eyes lit up when she spoke about her passions, and how her smile could brighten even the darkest of days. He found himself falling deeper in love with every passing moment, drawn to her like a moth to a flame.As their connection deepened, he realized that getting close to her meant not only embracing the joy and happiness they shared, but also being there for her during the challenging times. He became her rock, offering support and understanding when she needed it most. Their bond grew stronger with each obstacle they faced together, solidifying their commitment to one another.In her embrace, he found a sanctuary, a place where he could be his truest self without fear of judgment. Getting close to her meant peeling away the layers of his own insecurities and allowing himself to be vulnerable. It meant trusting her with his heart, knowing that she would handle it with care.As they continued on their journey together, he relished in the closeness they had cultivated. He knew that their connection was a precious gift, one that demanded nurturing and love. And so, he vowed to cherish every moment, every shared experience, and to continue getting closer to her, day by day, as they navigated the beautiful intricacies of their intertwined lives.He stood there, feeling a mix of anticipation and nervousness, as he realized he didn't really know the rules for a date he had done romantic things but never a true date, and that showed him how much he was always fighting for an existence he probably only ever outright asked one person in his life for a date face to face in a formal sense. In that moment, a wave of self-doubt washed over him, leaving him questioning his ability to navigate the realm of romantic connections. He couldn't help but feel like he hadn't truly lived, as he had missed out on the experiences and knowledge that others seemed to effortlessly possess.As he watched others effortlessly glide through the intricacies of dating, he couldn't help but feel like an outsider, unsure of the unspoken rules that governed these interactions. He found himself constantly questioning his every move, fearing that he would make a misstep or say the wrong thing. It seemed as though everyone else had a manual for dating, while he was left fumbling in the dark.The feeling of not having truly lived weighed heavily on him. He yearned for the adventures, the laughter, the joy that came with exploring romantic connections. He wanted to experience the thrill of getting to know someone new, the excitement of a first date, and the intimacy of shared moments. But the fear of making mistakes and the lack of knowledge held him back, leaving him feeling like he had missed out on so much.However, in the midst of his self-doubt, a glimmer of hope emerged. He realized that not knowing the rules didn't mean he couldn't learn them. He acknowledged that everyone had to start somewhere, and that it was never too late to begin.With newfound determination, he decided to embark on a journey of self-discovery and growth. He sought out advice from trusted friends and mentors, learning about the art of conversation, the importance of active listening, and the beauty of vulnerability. He immersed himself in books and articles, absorbing knowledge about dating etiquette, communication styles, and the intricacies of building a connection.As they embarked on their boat adventure, he felt a surge of excitement and determination. He was ready to take control and lead her to a place that would leave an indelible mark on their hearts. With a steady hand on the wheel, he guided the boat through calm waters, navigating the waves with confidence and grace.As they sailed along, he observed the anticipation in her eyes, a reflection of his own eagerness to create a moment that would be cherished forever. He knew that this was his chance to show her his adventurous spirit, his ability to take charge and create unforgettable experiences.With a mischievous smile, he veered away from the familiar route, heading towards a hidden cove that he had discovered during his previous sailing expeditions. The cove was a secluded paradise, untouched by crowds and brimming with natural beauty. He knew it held the potential to become their very own secret sanctuary.As they approached the cove, he skillfully maneuvered the boat, finding the perfect spot to drop anchor. As he secured the boat, he couldn't help but notice the excitement and curiosity dancing in her eyes. It was time to reveal the surprise he had planned.With a flourish, he produced a picnic basket filled with their favorite delicacies and a blanket to create a cozy setting. He invited her to join him on the bow of the boat, where they could enjoy the breathtaking view of the cove.As they sat beneath the sun-kissed sky, he shared stories of his adventures, his voice filled with passion and enthusiasm. He encouraged her to share her own dreams and desires, fostering a sense of intimacy and connection. It was in these moments of vulnerability that their bond deepened, as they unveiled the layers of their souls to one another.After their picnic, he led her to explore the cove, hand-in-hand, discovering hidden trails and secret alcoves. They immersed themselves in the beauty of nature, breathing in the salty air and relishing in the tranquility of the surroundings. It was a journey of discovery, not only of the hidden treasures within the cove but also of the depths of their connection.As the sun began its descent, painting vibrant hues across the sky, he guided her back to the boat, ready to embark on the final leg of their adventure. With a renewed sense of purpose, he set sail towards a nearby island, known for its breathtaking sunsets.As they reached the island, he found the perfect spot for them to witness the magical display in the sky. They sat in awe, watching as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow across the water. In that moment, time seemed to stand still, as they basked in the beauty of the world around them, feeling grateful for the shared experience.As the day drew to a close, he navigated the boat back to their starting point, cherishing the memories they had created together. He knew that this adventure had been more than just a boat ride; it had been a testament to his ability to take charge, to lead with confidence and create moments that would forever be etched in their hearts.As they disembarked from the boat, he looked into her eyes, knowing that this was just the beginning of their journey together. With every adventure they embarked on, he vowed to continue taking control, leading her to places both physically and emotionally, where they could create memories that would last a lifetime.As they embarked on their boat adventure, he felt a surge of excitement and determination.

It was time to reveal the surprise he had planned.With a flourish, he produced a picnic basket filled with their favorite delicacies and a blanket to create a cozy setting. He invited her to join him on the bow of the boat, where they could enjoy the breathtaking view of the cove.As they sat beneath the sun-kissed sky, he shared stories of his adventures, his voice filled with passion and enthusiasm. He encouraged her to share her own dreams and desires, fostering a sense of intimacy and connection. It was in these moments of vulnerability that their bond deepened, as they unveiled the layers of their souls to one another.After their picnic, he led her to explore the cove, hand-in-hand, discovering hidden trails and secret alcoves. They immersed themselves in the beauty of nature, breathing in the salty air and relishing in the tranquility of the surroundings. It was a journey of discovery, not only of the hidden secrets within the cove but also of the depths of their connection.As the sun began its descent, painting vibrant hues across the sky, he guided her back to the boat, ready to embark on the final leg of their adventure. With a renewed sense of purpose, he set sail towards a nearby island, known for its breathtaking sunsets.As they reached the island, he found the perfect spot for them to witness the magical display in the sky. They sat in awe, watching as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow across the water. In that moment, time seemed to stand still, as they basked in the beauty of the world around them, feeling grateful for the shared experience.As the day drew to a close, he navigated the boat back to their starting point, cherishing the memories they had created together. He knew that this adventure had been more than just a boat ride; it had been a testament to his ability to take charge, to lead with confidence and create moments that would forever be etched in their hearts.As they disembarked from the boat, he looked into her eyes, knowing that this was just the beginning of their journey together. With every adventure they embarked on, he vowed to continue taking control, leading her to places both physically and emotionally, where they could create memories that would last a lifetime.They discovered shared interests, common goals, and aspirations that aligned as if they were destined to meet. Each story told and laughter shared deepened the connection between them.Unbeknownst to them, their flirtatious banter danced in the air like a playful game. They exchanged witty remarks, teasing one another with gentle jests that revealed their quick wit and sharp minds. Their eyes locked in moments of intense connection, the unspoken language of attraction weaving its magic between them.As the evening progressed, their chemistry grew stronger, and their inhibitions began to fade. The man found himself enraptured by her infectious laughter, so he shared jokes and funny anecdotes, relishing in the sound of her joy. The woman, in turn, revealed her vulnerability, allowing the man to glimpse the layers beneath her captivating facade.With each passing moment, their gestures became more intentional. The man brushed his hand against hers, sending a shiver down her spine. She coyly played with a strand of her hair, a subtle invitation that spoke volumes. Their bodies leaned closer, their hearts beating in sync as the magnetic pull between them intensified.As the night drew to a close, the man and woman found themselves lost in the enchantment of the moment. Their eyes locked once more, and with a mixture of courage and vulnerability, they leaned in for a gentle, yet electrifying, kiss. Time stood still as their lips met, sealing the promise of a blossoming connection.It was a date filled with flirtation, intrigue, and the undeniable chemistry that can only exist between two souls who have discovered a mutual spark. And as they bid each other farewell, their hearts brimming with anticipation, they silently vowed to continue their enchanting journey of love and discovery together.As he sat close to her, he could feel the warmth radiating from her presence. The proximity sent a comforting shiver down his spine, as if their souls were whispering secrets only they could hear. The closeness created an intimate space, where words were unnecessary, and their connection spoke volumes.He marveled at the way her hair gently danced in the breeze, the way her eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief, and the way her laughter filled the air, captivating everyone around her. Sitting next to her, he felt a magnetic pull, drawing him closer, as if their souls were magnetically entwined.In this closeness, he found solace and a sense of belonging. Their bodies may have been inches apart, but their hearts were intertwined, beating in harmony. The world around them seemed to fade into the background, leaving only the two of them in a bubble of shared intimacy.As they sat close, he could feel her presence like a gentle caress against his skin. Her subtle movements, the brush of her arm against his. The closeness awakened a deep desire to explore the depths of their connection, to dive into the uncharted territory of their emotions.In this moment, he realized that sitting close to her was more than just physical proximity; it was an invitation to dive into vulnerability, to open his heart and soul to her. He longed to listen to her dreams, her fears, and her aspirations, to be a pillar of support and understanding.As they sat close, he found comfort in the silence that enveloped them. Words were unnecessary, as their bodies spoke a language only they understood. It was in this quiet closeness that he felt a profound sense of peace, as if everything in the world was aligned, and they were exactly where they were meant to be.In the closeness, he discovered a canvas of endless possibilities. He imagined adventures they could embark on together, memories they could create, and a future that held infinite potential. Sitting close to her, he felt a deep sense of gratitude for the moments they shared and a renewed determination to cherish every second.As time passed, they may have eventually moved apart, but the closeness they shared would forever be imprinted in their hearts. It was a reminder that in the presence of someone special, sitting close could create a world, where love, understanding, and connection thrived.As the man's smile began to fade, he found himself captivated by the enigmatic aura surrounding the woman. She wore a flowing sundress that danced with the gentle breeze, accentuating her graceful presence. Around her neck, a necklace adorned with shells, each containing a story waiting to be unraveled.Intrigued by the significance of each shell, the man's curiosity got the better of him. He found himself drawn to the mystery and depth that the woman seemed to carry within her. With genuine interest, he questioned her about the approximate length of each narrative encapsulated in those delicate shells.She looked at him, her eyes gleaming with a mixture of wisdom and playfulness. She delicately raised her hands, each shell cradled between her fingers, as if holding a precious gem. With a soft smile, she began to share her perspective.\"Each shell,\" she began, \"holds within it an entire ocean of history.\" Her voice carried a gentle cadence, as if whispering secrets of the sea. \"Every wave that crashes upon the shore, every seashell that finds its way to the sand, carries with it tales of forgotten lands, ancient creatures, and the ebb and flow of life itself.\"As she held up one shell, she described the vastness of the oceans that it once called home. She spoke of the creatures that sought refuge within its protective curves and the currents that carried it across vast distances. She explained how each shell had been shaped and molded by time and nature, embodying the essence of resilience and adaptation.With each shell, she unveiled a new chapter, a snippet of the world that existed beneath the surface. She told tales of sunken treasures, mythical creatures, and the whispers of long-lost civilizations. The man listened intently, his imagination running wild with the vivid images she painted with her words.As he absorbed her stories, he realized that within each shell lay not just history, but also a reflection of the woman before him. Like the shells, she held within her a wealth of experiences, emotions, and memories. Her choice to wear them proudly around her neck was a testament to her desire to carry the weight of her own journey with grace and dignity.In that moment, the man's initial curiosity transformed into a profound admiration for the woman and the depth of her being. He recognized that her impenetrable stance was not a shield, but rather a testament to the layers of strength and resilience she had cultivated over time.The fading smile on his face was replaced by a newfound appreciation for the complexities of life and the beauty that lies within the stories we carry. And as they continued their conversation, the man listened, enraptured by the tales within each shell, eager to understand the depths of the oceans that shaped the woman before him. so then this was It he knew that you did'nt sleep with someone on a first date. even if he did see her as a woman he could marry and a woman he may have already kissed danced and been quite intoxicated with this was like a renewal he couldn't just ignore the rules and have sex with her now it would also mean there was nothing special about him. part of what happened was the weight of the burden of not being able to say what he waited so long for got too heavy. however if she asked him to sleep with her he would probably oblige due to a lack of control over her influence which could unfortunately cause him appear as someone who had lied the entire time. This was a common occurrence of how could you know all these things if you where this the entire time. it was no different to a drawing habit or a writing habit or a training habit. the answer was because he desperately wanted to know. As he stood there, captivated by her radiant presence, he struggled to find the words to describe her ethereal beauty. Her sun-kissed skin seemed to glow with an inner light, as if she held the power of the sun within her. Her eyes, like shimmering pools of liquid gold, sparkled with warmth and mystery.Adorned around her neck was a mesmerizing necklace, crafted from countless shells of various shapes and sizes. Each shell seemed to carry a story of its own, whispering tales of distant shores and hidden treasures. The necklace cascaded down her collarbone, creating a delicate and alluring frame for her graceful neck.As he tried to capture the essence of this sun goddess, he felt a surge of inspiration. He likened her to the embodiment of the sun itself, radiating warmth and light to all those around her. Her presence was magnetic, drawing people in with an irresistible charm.In that moment, he realized that no words could truly do justice to her celestial allure. She was a living masterpiece, a celestial being walking among mortals. And as he continued to gaze at her, he knew that he was witnessing something truly extraordinary.       As the days turned into weeks, the connection between him and the sun goddess grew stronger. They spent hours lost in conversation, exploring the depths of their souls and sharing their dreams and aspirations. Each encounter felt like a cosmic dance, with their energies intertwining and creating a harmonious symphony.They embarked on countless adventures together, chasing sunsets on distant shores and basking in the glow of starlit nights. With every passing moment, their bond deepened, fueled by a shared love for the beauty and wonder of the world.One day, as they stood on a cliff overlooking the vast expanse of the ocean, the sun goddess turned to him with a twinkle in her eyes. \"There is a secret place,\" she whispered, her voice carrying the melody of a thousand sunsets. \"A place where time stands still and dreams come alive.\"Intrigued and captivated by her words, he followed her lead. They embarked on a journey into the unknown, guided by the sun goddess's intuition and the promise of something extraordinary. Through dense jungles and treacherous terrains, they pressed on, their spirits undeterred by the challenges that lay ahead.Finally, they arrived at their destination—a hidden valley bathed in golden light. The air was thick with magic and the scent of blooming flowers. In the center of the valley stood a magnificent tree, its branches reaching towards the heavens.The sun goddess approached the tree and whispered a heartfelt prayer. Instantly, the tree burst into a symphony of colors, its leaves transforming into shimmering orbs of light. They danced around the couple, creating a breathtaking display of beauty and enchantment.In that moment, he understood the true nature of the sun goddess. She was not merely a mortal woman touched by the sun's rays; she was a conduit of its power and wisdom. And he realized that he, too, had been forever changed by their encounter.From that day forward, they became guardians of the hidden valley, protecting its magic and sharing its wonders with those who sought solace and inspiration. Together, they created a sanctuary where dreams could take flight and the beauty of the world could be cherished.And so, their story continued, intertwined with the celestial forces that had brought them together. They embarked on an eternal journey of love, exploration, and the pursuit of the divine. And as they stood hand in hand, bathed in the glow of the sun goddess's radiance, they knew that their love would endure for all eternity.As he continued to speak, weaving his words in an attempt to convey the intricate concept of time dilation and eternal solar bliss, a realization dawned upon him. He understood the delicacy of the situation, knowing that she would soon discern his hidden desires and intentions.Yet, alongside his longing for this cosmic connection, he couldn't ignore the lingering presence of mortality. The coughing persisted, a reminder of his own mortality, as if fate was reminding him that time was slipping through his grasp. He yearned for a way to transcend the boundaries of time and space, to merge his past and future in a perfect cycle of reflection.With his gaze fixed upon the pole stars, he sought solace in their unwavering energy. He closed his eyes, allowing the magnitude of their celestial presence to envelop him. In that moment, he sensed a shift in the atmosphere, as if the universe itself was responding to his plea.As he opened his eyes, he beheld a breathtaking sight. Her sun dress, once radiant with celestial energy, now emitted a brilliant cyan holy fire. The fabric seemed to pulsate with power, as if it were birthing something new and transcendent. The fire spread, further illuminating her slender form, infusing her with a newfound strength.He realized that this was a pivotal moment, a manifestation of the connection he had yearned for. The sun goddess, with her divine essence, was becoming a conduit for the merging of past and future, for the creation of a ring of time.Without hesitation, he stepped forward, his heart filled with both trepidation and hope. As he embraced her, the ring of time began to form around them. Their bodies became enveloped in a luminous, swirling vortex, where past and future intertwined seamlessly.In this transcendent state, they found solace and eternal bliss. Time, no longer a constraint, became a fluid entity that they could navigate together. They existed in a perpetual dance of reflection and creation, their souls forever entwined in the cosmic tapestry of existence.As the cyan holy fire continued to radiate from her dress, they reveled in the boundless possibilities that lay before them. They reveled in the gift of this eternal solar connection, knowing that they had found their rightful home in the ring of time. And in that moment, mortality seemed distant and inconsequential, for they had transcended its grasp and embraced the infinite.clouded the mind of a man who found himself at the center of her attention. He was aware that his memories had been tampered with, leaving him in a state of disarray. However, deep within his being, he held the belief that if he could trigger the right sounds, the truth would unveil itself.As the woman gracefully rose from her seat, her dress seemed to come alive, transforming into a mesmerizing cascade of fabric that draped around her body, elegantly sweeping the floor. The air crackled with anticipation as her arms extended upward, reaching toward the heavens. And just like that, she began to grow, her form expanding to extraordinary heights. Though it was impossible to discern her true height, it was clear that she towered above the ordinary.In an unexpected turn of events, she reached out and seized the bewildered man, swiftly tossing him into her mouth. His mind raced with a mix of fear and curiosity as he found himself enveloped by the darkness within. Through gritted teeth, she commanded him to stay inside, her voice echoing within the vast expanse of her being. Through the walls of her throat, he caught glimpses of swirling clouds rushing by, a testament to her immense power. It became evident that she was reaching for the sun, contemplating her next move with a cosmic intensity. The man could feel the weight of her decision hanging in the air, unsure of what awaited him beyond the endless expanse of her being.As he ventured deeper into the abyss of her throat, he realized the precariousness of his situation. The damaged state of his body urged caution, and he knew that the vastness of outer space would only exacerbate his frailty. Determined to find stability amidst the chaos, he focused on creating a stable ring, an anchor to hold onto.As the man found himself nestled near the back of her ocean-like tongue, he could sense the surge of energy emanating from the sun. Heat enveloped him, intensifying as she drew in the power of the celestial sphere. Sensing the rising temperatures, he cautiously maneuvered himself beneath her tongue, seeking refuge in the relative coolness there.Shielded from direct view, he could not witness the events unfolding outside her vast being. But he could feel the tension in the air, the weight of her intentions hanging palpably. And then, with a burst of radiant brilliance, she unleashed a powerful ray of oceanic light from her mouth and throat, a force that irradiated her enemies to mere lightened sand only left as light weight beach decoration.The destructive display left an indelible mark on the planet, obliterating all who stood against her. The man, though uncertain of his own role in this grand design, couldn't help but feel a surge of awe and trepidation. He realized that he was entangled in a cataclysmic dance of fate, where the woman's extraordinary powers held the potential to reshape the world.In the aftermath of the devastating display, as the dust slowly settled, a profound silence descended upon the scene. The man, still encased within her, wondered what lay ahead. Would he be consumed by her power, forever lost within the depths of her being? Or would he emerge from this journey with newfound clarity and the ability to reclaim his shattered memories?With each passing moment, the tapestry of their intertwined destinies grew more intricate, and the man could sense that his path was intricately woven into the fabric of her existence. As the celestial sun goddess returned to her normal height, she gently reached down and plucked the tiny human from her mouth. Looking down at him with curiosity in her eyes, she asked him to describe her once again.Caught in a state of fascination, the human struggled to find the words to capture the goddess's magnificence. His gaze was drawn to her mouth, which had held him captive not too long ago. Every detail of her being seemed to radiate an ethereal beauty that left him in awe.The goddess, sensing his hesitation, smiled knowingly. She had noticed him observing her for some time now, intrigued by her ability to transform lives. She had a unique gift of drawing out the potential in individuals, helping them become something redeemable.Now, for the first time, she asked the human to play a role in passing judgment. She longed for more enemies, for those who showed no remorse, consideration, or intention to change. She knew that they were the ones who needed to be judged, for their actions affected countless lives.However, the task proved to be difficult for the human. Though he too had found inspiration in her ability to transform lives, he had only observed from a distance. For him, the act of passing judgment required a deep introspection and understanding of the souls he encountered.He recognized the weight of the responsibility bestowed upon him. But as he watched the goddess's radiant presence, he felt a surge of determination rise within him. He vowed to follow in her footsteps, seeking out those without remorse or willingness to change.It wasn't an easy path. The human faced countless challenges, encountered individuals who tested his own patience and capacity for forgiveness. Yet, he remained steadfast in his mission. With each person he encountered, he sought to understand their intentions, their capacity for change.In his pursuit of justice, he discovered that even those who seemed irredeemable at first had the potential for transformation. With time and compassion, he witnessed the miracles that unfolded when people were given a chance to realize their mistakes and make amends.The celestial sun goddess watched proudly as the human flourished in his newfound role. Their purpose intertwined, they worked together to bring about redemption and change in the lives of those who needed it most.Together, they became a beacon of hope and guidance. And as the human continued his journey, he discovered that in the end, it was not about judgment, but about fostering empathy and understanding. It was about helping others recognize their own potential for growth and finding the courage to take the necessary steps towards redemption. he was aware she may judge him also for not showing signs of stopping but he would recommend her course of action for those who where too evil to stop or put them somewhere they cant possibly hurt anybody else. he was' not sure about if it was good to discuss the details of conflict when he should just be trying to describe his date.\n\n"],["The two-centimeter tall Dmitri gaped in both awe and terror. “Open Sesame,” he mumbled to himself as a large and cavernous crimson maw opened wide before him. A pink behemoth of a rough-surfaced beast leapt out and greeted him. The creature masqueraded itself as a red carpet and unfurled towards him. Cautiously he stepped onto the turbulent rose-coloured carpet and ventured into the dark cavern. He noted grimly that the lumpy being, on which he stood, had deceived him and was slowly withdrawing itself into the cavern. At the entrance of the maw, the thirty-two marble-like pillars which he had previously viewed as symbols of hospitality of a mysterious civilization, slammed into each other and sealed the entrance of the cavern. Instantaneously, the light in the cavern dissolved into oblivion and the cavern was consumed by darkness. Dmitri bent as the ceiling caved-in on him. His legs shook and he was almost tempted to collapse onto the shaky floor. But his ambitions emboldened him and he decided to get to task. He buckled down on his knees and his hands desperately groped for a flashlight. Upon finding it in his suit’s leg-pocket, he summoned rays of light to aid him in his task. The light rays reflected off glistening gums and teeth. Strands of Saliva ran down from the ceiling to the floor like cobwebs. Warm steam circulated in the cave and condensed onto the glass of his helmet like mist. Dmitri noted that it was very unusual for the mouth to be closed while he worked. He placed his medical shoulder-bag onto the tongue and hastily pulled out a miniature-dentist rope (a hybrid sturdy rope custom-designed for “small” dentists). He quickly attached it’s hooked end into the hole in his suit’s anklet. He put the noose-end of the rope around his patient’s lower canine. Dmitri then proceeded to retrieve his flashlight from the floor, and scouted for plaque. With a scalpel, he began scraping off some plaque from the teeth. His “patient’s” mouth suddenly became more turbulent and Dmitri found himself being thrown to the back of her mouth. His upper body dangled into her throat and triggered a reflex action. Dmitri’s blonde crush, Susan gulped. Wow! So my surprise precaution-training examination is today huh? an astonished  Dmitri asked himself. Within a fraction of a second, Dmitri found himself being constricted through a narrow tight tube. Well, I had always wanted to get inside her. I guess they were right when they said be careful what you wish for, Dmitri thought to himself. Susan rubbed her neck nervously; she could feel him plummeting down her throat. \n \nAmanda, Dmitri’s invigilator, walked up and down the white table impatiently. “Detach the rope,” she commanded. Her young male sub-ordinate slammed his finger down on his smartphone’s screen. Susan could still feel the noose of the rope around her canine but the rest of the rope slithered down her throat like a long strand of spaghetti. Susan gasped, “Oh my God! That felt so weird. I am sorry but I don’t think I’ll be able to do this anymore!” Amanda looked up at Susan and raised her eyebrow. “What? Why?” Susan, whose head was still awkwardly pressed against the table, spoke with great difficulty, “Ma’am, this is so yucky! I feel nauseated. I feel like a cannibal now. I regret that I ever signed up for this” Her eyes, like the weak walls of an ancient un-repaired dam, were destined to give in to the liquid whose pressure was building up at an uncontrollable rate. Amanda rolled her eyes whilst mumbling, “Youngsters are such a nuisance these days.” Daniel, Amanda’s male sub-ordinate, walked towards her. The handsome young man’s eyes locked themselves onto Susan’s enormous face (and she felt herself blush) but his words were directed towards Amanda. His melodious and confident voice said, “Oh c’mon Ma’am, don’t be so rough on her. Wouldn’t you feel uncomfortable if a living, breathing person was sliding down your throat?” Daniel’s beauty, confidence and charm acted as a sensory overload to most people, including Amanda, and very few people could resist his charismatic nature. His divine nectarine-like voice seeped into the vaults of Susan’s soul and soothed her entire body. Amanda snapped out of his spell and gnashed at him, “Well Daniel, firstly, it is impossible for me to feel a person slide down my throat because we [Amanda & Daniel] are the smaller of the two humanoid races that exist, there is nobody smaller than us; therefore you are putting me in an unrealistic situation. Secondly, even if such a situation were to somehow magically occur, I believe that I would be more understanding of the situation and be more sympathetic towards the circumstances. And thirdly Daniel, who are you to tell me how to behave?” Daniel heaved a loud sigh. He said softly, “My sincerest apologies Ma’am. I think Susan is just worried about Dmitri.” Susan noticed that Daniel’s large teal eyes were still locked onto her; they burned brightly and seared the image of their master into her mind and heart. “Don’t worry Susan! The suit will keep him safe. And plus, how do you expect him to pass the examination and get a practicing license without this test?” Daniel reassured her. Susan replied, “I hope so. I really don’t want to become a cannibal.” Amanda said, “That won’t happen. There’s a camera in his helmet. Let’s see how well he is doing in there. Daniel, switch on the camera.” Her gaze shifted to the large television that hung on the wall. Her inquisitive eyes burnt bright with a spark of restlessness as the screen flickered to life. She said quietly, “Daniel, please do not switch on the microphone yet.”\n \nDmitri panicked. The chord that had prevented the oesophagus from dragging him into the dark dungeons of Susan had snapped. He splashed into an acidic blend of Hydrochloric acid, cold drink, tea, water, chocolate smoothy and God knows what. He could see large chocolatey islands, the remnants of what had once been a wonderful cake, floating around in her stomach. Boluses of chicken-sandwiches and lettuce-salad could also be seen. A way to a woman’s heart…is through her stomach, he chuckled to himself in a failed attempt to calm himself. The fortresses surrounding the acidic lake groaned and grunted loudly; then they began to churn violently: collapsing inwards in one moment and pushing themselves away from the lake at the next. She eats so much junk; how is she not obese yet? He wondered. The liquid in Susan’s stomach bubbled and glowed neon under Dmitri’s torchlight; it reminded him of mythical witches’ potions. It swirled into a mighty whirlpool and successfully dragged a mighty chocolate-cake ship under its surface. The chocolate-ship bobbed up and down like a desperate wildebeest trying to escape from the maws of the crocodile pulling it under water. Dmitri’s mind was clouded by trepidation and it nearly paralyzed him. \n \nAmanda’s voice suddenly boomed around him through the speakers in his helmet and shook him back to reality. The voice croaked, “Dear Student, your precaution-training test will begin in 2 minutes. We would like to remind you that you have half-an-hour to complete this test. You’ll be given a few tasks and you must complete the tests to pass the examination.” Dmitri quickly started swimming through the turbulent lake to a chocolate mountain and he hastily attempted to scale it. Upon reaching the top, he reached out to his medical shoulder bag… only to realize that it wasn’t there. “Shit, that bag was open,” he mumbled to himself. After a lot of effort, he finally spotted the bag floating at the circumference of an acidic whirlpool; Dmitri gravely noted that the mouth of the bag was immersed in the acid; this probably meant that most of his stuff had escaped from the bag. What was he expected to do now? Was he expected to go and retrieve his materials or was he only supposed to focus on the examination? Amanda squinted her eyes at the screen. ‘What on Earth is he doing?’ she thought to herself. She continued, “Upon completing these tasks, you’ll have to…” Dmitri wasn’t listening. His heart thumped hard against his chest. He knew how dangerous it was for medical material to be floating around in the patient’s stomach. He couldn’t hear all of Amanda’s jabber. He strained his ears but his panic-stricken mind could only process a few words,“…climb…the drone…. rope…. leave… ” Although he didn’t pay close attention to what Amanda said, he knew what she expected him to do. But he needed to retrieve his medical bag’s materials from her stomach to do it. Dmitri sighed, he knew that he had no choice- he’d have to retrieve all of the bag’s original contents.\n \nAmanda widened her eyes. “I can’t believe it… he has somehow managed to spill the contents of the medical bag.” Susan gasped, “What now?” Daniel squinted his eyes; he said, “I think he is trying to salvage all of his materials.” Susan asked nervously, “What if he forgets a thing or two in there?” Amanda shrugged. Susan exclaimed, “WHAT?” Daniel giggled. “Oh Susan!” he added, “Everything will be fine. Don’t worry!” Amanda let out a squeal. She slammed her palm onto her forehead. “What happened?” asked Daniel. “That blundering fool has somehow managed to get sucked into the small intestines.” Susan nearly fainted. “What now?” asked Daniel; his voice strongly hinting of the possibility of concern. “Well I am afraid that our friend can exit through only one route now.” Susan teared up and said, “I really don’t like this. Can’t I just puke him out?” Amanda replied, “No, it is too late for that now. He can’t be puked out because he is already in your intestine.” “Well you can’t just leave him in there!” “I have no other alternative.” “Aren’t there laws against this kind of thing? Can’t you be sued for this?” “Fortunately for me,” Amanda said smiling, “the answer is no to both your questions.” “OK… what about the stuff that is still stuck in my stomach?” Amanda sighed, “Well that… that we can retrieve.”\n \n","An extract from the Diary of Susan Smith:\nMonday, 10th October 2050.\nMonday, the worst day of the week. Could today be the worst Monday of my life? Will I, in my life, encounter Mondays that are any worse than this? Better not answer that. I finally understand a popular phrase (or at least I think this phrase is commonly used) of the English language, ‘Always trust your intuition.’ I had a severe case of Monday-morning-blues today. I should have listened to my body and not turned up to the University today. Ugh… today was like the black sheep of all the days of my life (memo. highlight today’s day and date in the diary; today can’t be forgotten). \nToday started off as a normal working day (it is good that we have a holiday tomorrow and day-after; don’t ask me why though, I don’t know and I don’t care enough to find out). I woke up at 4.30 in the morning (#sad; the problems of having to share 1 bathroom-toilet with roommates; most girls get into the toilet together but I, as mentioned before in this diary, find that to be very disgusting- maybe this is because I was raised up in a predominantly male family) and brushed my teeth while I showered. Then I enhanced my looks with a light brush of makeup whilst at the same time using the toilet (I used my new hand mirror… duh! It is so much more convenient). Then I… never mind, I don’t think there is a point of me writing about my repetitive daily routine everyday… let’s just speed forward a bit.\nMy day at the University started as usual with most of the men gawking and commenting on my awe-inspiring voluptuous body. Some women did too (Both genders find me sexy! Yaay! :D). But who can blame them, am I right? ;D I am the very definition of sexy after all, the perfect creation of God (JK… no actually I ain’t kidding). But I am starting to feel that I am nothing more than a pretty face. My beauty is what tames and makes me likable to most people. But what happens after I grow old when my beauty withers away? What happens if I get injured in an accident? Will people still love me? I guess only time will tell… \nAnyway, let’s get back to the story that leads us to the main event of the day, shall we? I was very nervous today because today was well, a big day… not for me though… but for the ligo students (they didn’t know it though, it was a surprise examination. We all knew it was coming but didn’t know when- I was only given a notice privately today by the staff because I had, in exchange for a generous offer, volunteered for it.)  Some of the ligo students have complained (this has been going on for a while now but nobody seems to care) that these “precaution-training examinations” were racist as only they (the ligo students) had to take them. I partially agree with them but I believe that it is a necessary evil; although it is clearly discrimination, it is actually good for them and could potentially be life-saving for them.  \nAnyway getting right to the point. The guy who was giving an exam in my mouth was… Dmitri. Yep Dmitri! Of all the ligo students, I got Dmitri. Now I don’t really hate Dmitri or anything. It is just that he is an awkward geek (like me lmao) who has a massive crush on me. It is not that I hate him or anything, it just gets really awkward for me when he’s around. I have been his partner for the entire course (there’s still a year left before the finals; we’ll soon be having mock examinations; ligo students who fail this examination will not be permitted to attempt the finals- is it unfair?). Anyway Ms Amanda, the demonic bitch (I usually respect my teachers and don’t call them mean things. But believe me, this one’s a sadistic bastard), was the one who was supervising the exams. And the University Hottie Daniel was volunteering too. He was a ligo but god knows how he managed to not give the exams and volunteer instead (perhaps he finished giving the exams last year?). Anyway I couldn’t stop blushing and I was afraid that Dmitri might think that I was blushing because of him.\nI prepared to swallow Dmitri as per Amanda’s instructions but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Luckily (or unluckily), he triggered a gag relax and I gulped. I could feel him sliding down my throat. The feeling was… indescribable. I would say it is something like swallowing worms- just this one was a bit larger and more lively (and human!). I wanted to throw up because I realised that I had swallowed a human being- the thought of my belly digesting him gave me goosebumps and made me want to regurgitate. The following events could be summarized in a few sentences: I started crying; Amanda was an asshole to me; Daniel stood up for me (I think he likes me too!); the bitch snapped at him too; Daniel apologized for his conduct (what a gentleman) and then we switched on the camera on Dmitri’s suit (I was told to not worry as the suit would prevent him from getting digested but I was nervous any way). I got to see my stomach from the inside- it was amazing! I saw pieces of chocolate cake floating around- this chocolate cake was my best friend for like 10 minutes (before I ate all of it)- I miss you buddy!\nDmitri- that imbecile!- he had left his bag open and all of its contents spewed out into my stomach. That idiot also managed to get sucked into my intestines. Amanda told me that the only way out for him was through my butthole. Was she actually expecting me to poop this guy out? (memo. google ‘how do I poop a guy out without him seeing my butt?’) Yuck! I feel bad for him now. Amanda was kind enough to send in a professional diver (Daniel <3) to retrieve the materials. I was reluctant as I was afraid that he’d get sucked into my intestines and I’d have to poop him out too but he assured me that it wouldn’t happen. He hastily brought back all of the materials that had been floating around in my stomach. Amanda simply sent me home. Nobody from the University’s administration bothered to check on with me about Dmitri. But this news spread like wildfire across the University and I am afraid that at this rate this might appear in the news. Various students from the University though have already started asking me questions about this occurrence. Most of them think it is funny for some reason. I pity Dmitri- it must be so uncomfortable in there. I think he’s in my large intestines now. I’ll poop him out tomorrow morning. That poor fellow is probably starving by now. I’ll make him breakfast tomorrow. My roommates aren’t going to be here tomorrow; whatever happens tomorrow morning is going to be a lot less awkward (hopefully).\nHope to write again soon,\nSusie.\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………\nA golden beam of sunlight crept in through the window and caressed Susan on her rosy cheeks. In response, a mildly annoyed Susan squinted her eyes and dug deeper into her blanket. However her convenient shield could not prevent the loud thumping of footsteps, the cacophonous crashing of utensils and the head-splitting voices of her roommates from penetrating her ears. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t sleep through the disturbances for they were determined to tread on her wishes. \nSusan’s roommate Sophia called into her room,“Susie! Liz, Anna and me are leaving now. We have an adventurous and exciting camping-trip to look forward to.” A moderately annoyed Susan replied, “Ugh… Bye! Have fun!” Sophia said, “Bye! Um… Don’t forget to release your poor prisoner. He has probably drowned in his own sweat already.” Susan’s widening eyes, along with the other parts of her face, pronounced an expression of horror. She burst out of her comfy cocoon as soon as she heard her roommate’s key bid adieu to the lock who lived in the main door. Susan’s yawn marked the official end of her mini-hibernation; she was now ready to rescue the ill-fated lad who had a crush on her. Just one thing needed to be done before she rescued him…\nShe rushed to the kitchen, home to the most wondrous of things (like food for example). Susan’s left palm scouted the kettle’s metallic walls to see if it was still warm. It had touched the steaming kettle’s body for less than a fraction of a second when it retreated almost immediately, for it seemed as if the kettle wanted to barbecue it. You’ll get nothing until you release your little guest, he seemed to say. When Susan lifted the lid of the kettle, she felt as if she had exorcised the kettle for she was greeted by steam, the spirits of water molecules who were very desperate and wanted nothing more but to escape. Susan said in her mind, ‘The way I see it, you hadn’t released your guests either.’  \nSusan mumbled to herself, “I don’t think Elizabeth would mind if I borrowed some of her cutlery.” She gathered her ligo roommate’s cutlery in her palm: a teaspoon, a tablespoon and a mug. She hastily arranged them on the dining table when the grumpy kitchen-clock’s hands struck eight. He appeared to question, How much longer must that unfortunate soul suffer in your bowels? Susan departed at once to be Dmitri’s knight in shining armor. \nSusan brushed her teeth, washed her face and combed her hair in a jiffy before she sat on the toilet bowl. It wasn’t long before Dmitri plopped into the toilet bowl; he was alive and kicking but he was most certainly not happy- he looked like a mad famished wolf. Susan plucked him out and placed him in the sink. By the time she had finished wiping herself and flushing the toilet, Dmitri had emerged from his suit; he seemed most upset. Susan quickly prepared a warm bath for him in her soap-container. Susan informed him, “Here, have a bath while I bring you something to eat.” She motioned to the soap container- it was filled with a warm soapy bath. Susan departed momentarily and true to her promise, returned with food. She brought in her hands a large plate, on which was a large piece of hot brownie, a ligo-sized mug and a napkin.  \nShe found Dmitri in the bathtub. Upon realizing that she couldn’t possibly place the plate on the sink, she decided to put both the plate and the soap-container on the bathroom floor. It registered to her that Dmitri was nude and that she was looking at him without his consent- she apologized sincerely and left the bathroom without further ado. As she left, she said, “Once you are ready, please do come to the living room. I would like to converse with you.” \n \n"],["“There was an old witch, believe it if you can. She tapped on the windows, and she ran, ran, ran.”\n \nThat melody, that ghastly melody which petrified the souls of all who heard it. Such a sweet, upbeat tune had never sounded so terrifying. It echoed with such a force that made it impossible not to hear. Try as he might and as hard as he could cover his ears, Alan could not stop the rhymes from violating his senses.\n \nDark, dank wooden cupboards and shelves. Countless vials filled with colorful liquids. Glowing candles that offered only just enough light. Jars labelled with the names of fantastical beasts. Gazelles, Gryphons, Minotaurs, even Dragons. No creature was an exception it seemed. With the same dread he’d had the last hundred times he’d done so, Alan read his own jar’s label yet again.\n \nHuman\n \nNever before had such a common word carried with it such an intense despair. No matter how often he read it the impact remained the same. That was all they were now, specimens in a jar. Such a stark realization sucked any notion of resistance right out of him.\n \nAlan gazed at those who shared his fate, both coping in their own unique ways. To his right a young man with lengthy brown hair sat against the surface of the glass hunched over, that would’ve been Matthew. At his left stood the blonde Jaime, panting for breath after the latest of his many escape attempts. Alan noted his palms were raw from how much he’d smacked their glass prison.\n \n“We never should’ve entered the woods.” Like a broken record Matthew repeated their mistake yet again. At this point Alan and Jaime just ignored him. In hindsight Matthew was right of course, he was from the beginning.\n \n“How did this happen?” The broken man sobbed as Jaime began pounding his fists against glass once again.\n \nThey knew how. They all did. They knew the stories, the tales about how a witch lived deep in the woods and liked to venture out and kidnap people from their homes. How she would take them to her hut where they would never return. Their parents told them for years: Do not enter the woods. They just didn’t listen. His lover protested his going, but he didn’t listen. They knew the dangers; Matthew even protested it from the beginning. But once they were goaded that was their undoing.\n \n“Relax Matt, we’ll just wander around the woods for a bit and come back. That’ll show those fools. Call us cowards will they?”\n \nOh what a fool he was. What fools they all were.\n \nNever in all his deepest dreams could he ever have envisioned the stories were true, and now here they were. Alan’s gaze wandered to the one who so casually doomed them.\n \nContrary to the stories the Witch was not a ghastly creature. If there was something unearthly to her it would have been her unnatural beauty. A pale, slender figure with curves any lady would be envious of. A serene expression set against shoulder-length black hair and deceptively warm eyes. She wore a form fitting dark dress that seemed every bit as alive as she was. Every single thing about her was unnaturally perfect. Were the circumstances any different she’d have been the apple of everyone’s eye. Now the mere sight of her made Alan want to retch.\n \nEver since they had awoken from her spell she stood there in the distance, towering at several stories high. She seemed hard at work, crafting some nefarious potion in that cauldron of hers no doubt. All their clothing and possessions were stripped from them along with their size, leaving them unable to do much more than wait. Not once did her dark gaze wander over in their direction. Since their imprisonment the only thing she did was torment them with her melodic voice.\n \n“She ran Helter-Skelter, with her toes in the air. Corn stalks were flying from the old witch’s hair.”\n \nShe moved with an ethereal grace, more akin to floating than shifting her feet. Each step thundered loudly against the strikingly loud creaks of the floorboards. Then her eyes wandered in their direction, and Alan felt his heart stop. With the same unnatural movements her hand reached out, lithe and perfectly trimmed fingers grasping one of the jars. Alan noted that the label read Dragon. Were there really dragons in such a small container? He couldn’t tell. Just his luck that only humans seemed to be worth keeping in transparent glass. All the other jars were opaque.\n \nHis heart skipped a beat as the Witch removed the lid and fire burst from within. Even Jaime’s insistent banging and Matthew’s whines were silenced. The Witch however was wholly unconcerned. Pale fingers slid into the container without hesitation, and out came the beast tucked securely in her grasp. From her scale it was little more than a miniscule lizard, yet the humans were awestruck. The Witch’s magic had reduced it to little more than horse size; but still, an actual honest to goodness, golden-scaled, dragon.\n \nThe magnificent creature fought desperately against the massive pads holding it in place. The Witch paid it little mind as she closed the jar and set it back, taking booming steps towards her cauldron once again. One of its wings was pinched between her forefinger and thumb while the other hand held his scaly body in much the same way.\n \n“Swish goes the broomstick, meow goes the cat!”\n \n In one simple movement the wing she’d be holding was forcibly pulled off. Even her omnipresent voice couldn’t drown out the sickening crack and the dragon’s wails of pain. Before anyone could react the Witch already had her fingers set on the other wing.\n \n“Plop goes the hoptoad sitting on her hat!”\n \nShe wore the happiest of smiles as the second wing came off. The Witch hummed to herself while she dropped both appendages into the cauldron below, quickly shifting her gaze to the mutilated beast before her.\n \n“I just love human rhymes. Don’t you?” She queried in a disturbingly happy tone.\n \nWhatever fight the dragon had left with its wings. The once defiant beast whimpered in pain between the Witch’s fingers. Its glorious golden scales now ruined with the fresh outpouring of blood from where the wings once protruded, slowly turning its shine into a sickening red.\n \n“Shame the recipe only calls for dragon wings. I hate wasting ingredients.” She tilted her head as she seemed to think on what to do with the remaining bits of the dragon.\n \nAlan’s stomach dropped, if such a thing was even possible at this point. This dragon, this magnificent beast, the literal inspiration for hundreds of ballads and fables. It was nothing but an ingredient to her. No different from pepper on a spice rack. Not even something as grand as a dragon was safe from her whims, let alone something as petty as a human. Unfortunately, he found the food comparison wasn’t far from the mark.\n \n“Well…Raw dragon isn’t the best, but it’s better than just throwing you away I guess.” Then the Witch did the unthinkable, and opened her mouth.\n \n“By the Gods, she isn’t…” Jaime said what they were all thinking.\n \nSeeming to realize what awaited him, the dragon began to fight once again. Yet it mattered not. The Witch’s maw overtook him. A moment later Alan and his friends watched the struggling bulge go down her throat.\n \n“Mmm~” Despite her words she seemed to relish the taste, enough to lick the beast’s blood from her fingertips at least.\n \nThen for the first time since Alan had seen her, the flawless visage scrunched up. A moment later a small, but still loud, belch escaped her mouth along with a tuft of fire. “Excuse me.” She chuckled.\n \n“We’re doomed.”\n \n“Matthew, shut up already.” Alan rolled his eyes, only realizing a moment later that this time it came from Jaime. The latest display finally forced him to face reality it seemed. The one was doing all the whining moments ago now nodded in solemn silence as Jaime took over whining duties.\n \nGreat, now there were two of them. Alan turned his eyes back from the duo in disgust. Even watching the Witch was more agreeable than constantly reminding himself of their imminent doom. A pity his friends didn’t realize that.\n \nThe Witch was already back at work on her cauldron. Near her person sat a massive tome she frequently checked. After a few moments she turned the page, her lips very swiftly turning into a wide smile as her eyes batted back towards the human jar specifically. Though Alan felt as though that soul wrenching gaze was locked on him in particular.\n \n“Brace yourselves, it’s time.” He found himself speaking even before the Witch took her powerful steps towards them. His depressed friends whimpered, very soon becoming little more than blubbering messes. In contrast, Alan stood stoically. The fear threatened to paralyze him. Sweat drenched his palms, and his heart was in danger of leaping from his chest. But, for whatever reason, he couldn’t bring himself to cry and whimper like the others. It wasn’t an act of defiance, merely one of acceptance.\n \nThe Witch approached the shelves all the jars stood on, and placed her hands around the human jar. Without pause it was lifted, and the humans flew like ragdolls against the opposite end of the glass, each letting out a pained grunt. In another moment the lid was casually removed. Their captor leaned in close to the opening and gazed within with a playful smirk. “Pardon me for being such a poor host. It’s not often I get visitors wandering into my woods. You should’ve sent a herald. I would’ve had time to prepare.” She giggled.\n \n“What are you going to do with us Witch?!” Jaime yelled skyward. The fear in his voice remained palpable.\n \nHer mirthful eyes narrowed, similar to a cat who found a new plaything. One of her fingers toyed with some of her dark hair. “I wonder? I’m still trying to decide. Humans are a very handy ingredient, useful for oh so many potions. But which to choose? Hmm…” Her voice thundered down from above, carrying a playful hint of teasing in each syllable.\n \n“J-J-Just let us go! Why are you doing this to us?!”\n \nThe Witch shrugged. “Why does a man wake up in the morning? Why does the crow caw at night? Why do the stars come and go?” Her lips came in closer. “They just do.” The whispers mocked them.\n \nAlan found his back pressed against the glass. The Witch’s presence was overwhelming. A voice that enticed while belittling them. Eyes he couldn’t veer away from, yet filled with utter disregard for their existence, and that mouth…That chasm that just ended a dragon before their very eyes. Everything about this was just wrong. All his instincts demanded he run, fight, do something. But it was pointless. They were literal bugs in a jar.\n \nIf only his two companions realized that, things would be so much easier. Matthew clung desperately to Jaime, who was trying to foolishly talk the Witch out of whatever machinations she had in store. Within his blissful acceptance Alan found their struggles almost pitiful.\n \n“Let us go Witch! You cannot do this, they will come for us! They will bring torches and pitchforks and-“\n \n“And what?” The chastising laughter silenced the loud mouthed blonde. “They will cower at the gateway to my domain. Oh they’ll try most certainly. But for all their shallow boasts they will flee the first chance they get. Like many before them.” There was no malice or cruelty in her upbeat tone, only the cold, hard truth. “And stop calling me Witch. I have a name, Lucida. Not that it’ll matter for much longer I think.”\n \nLucida, even her name held an unnatural charm to it.\n \n“Come to think of it…” Her playful gaze focused on Jaime and Matthew. “I think I have just the thing for you two.” Before the full weight of her words could sink in her hand reached within their glass prison. Alan felt all his hairs stand on edge as the digits closed in. He desperately scurried away, though the same couldn’t be said for his friends. For all their struggles the fingers ignored them entirely and grabbed the two by their chests, leaving only Alan in his heart pounding terror as the witch set the jar down and stepped into the adjacent room. The door magically shut behind her without any movement on her part.\n \nFive. Ten. Twenty.\n \nHow many minutes passed since she took them away? The thick walls of Lucida’s hut prevented him from hearing any of what was transpiring. All he knew was that every so often the edges of the door would glow a sickening green. How could she so effortlessly do this to them? Just because she was magical? Because they decided to be brash and enter her woods? For that they deserved all this? Alan’s arms wrapped around himself. It was the only comfort he could provide now.\n \nHis friends. His family. His fiancé. He’d never see any of them ever again. Any time he thought about that the edges of his eyes watered. His fate was inevitable at this point, he understood that. But the memories of everything he’d be leaving behind haunted him still.\n \nEventually the door opened once again, and Lucida stepped through with a particularly content smile. Her flawless form sucked the life from the human as she came near the jar once again.\n \n“What did you do to them?” He had to know. No matter how much he didn’t want to. Matthew and Jaime deserved that much.\n \nThe Witch ignored him, reaching for a stool in the distance. She grabbed the hems of her dress, and took a seat before propping up her booted feet on the table. Each massive foot was as large as the jar that held the human. “I wonder?” Lucida smiled.\n \nEven now the games continued. Alan wasn’t even surprised, just tired. “Please, they were my friends. Even someone like you has to realize that.”\n \nLucida reflected on that sentiment for a moment. Her eyes grew thoughtful. One of her ankles crossed over the other, allowing one foot to bop in place. The dark sole of her boot tapped idly on the glass a couple times. “What if I were to tell you that you were looking at them right now?”\n \nWhat nonsense was she saying now? All Alan could see was her…boots.\n \n“H-How-“\n \n“Quite simple really.” Lucida was already explaining. “I was in need of a new pair of shoes, my old ones were getting quite run down you see. A hundred years with a handful of shoes kind of do that. So it was an obvious choice once I realized it.”\n \nShe was serious. It really was that nonchalant of a thing for her. “You…”\n \n“Transfiguration is a simple, but tedious process.” The witch talked over him, rambling on while she played with her hair and admired her new boots. “You see, simply turning someone into an object isn’t enough. Their natural origins won’t accept it. They need to become the object, become boots in both body and soul.”\n \n“Please stop.”\n \n“Their wills were easy enough to break. A few charm spells and suddenly they threw themselves at my feet. Begging to lick and kiss and comfort them, pleading for me to stomp on them, praying to my feet like I were a God. My feet became their everything in mere minutes. They didn’t just want them. They needed them. If I pulled my feet back even an inch they would cry and beg for their return. It was quite empowering really.”\n \n“Please stop!”\n \n“I could make them do anything if it meant even a fraction of a second smelling the air around my toes. You’d be amazed child. How quickly they renounced their Gods for me to step on them. How much more important the dirt on my foot was than all their friends families. Once I was certain their adoration was enough I cast the spell and then-“\n \n“PLEASE STOP!”\n \nShe finally stopped. Her boots moved over so she could look directly at the human. Alan panted. Enough was enough. He could die, but this? This was too much.\n \n“Just…stop…” The human slumped back down.\n \n“Why are you so upset? Your friends got everything they desired.” Lucida smiled innocently. “They wanted to be with my feet for all eternity, and now they are. Their souls have been rewritten to be near what they hold so dear. You cannot hear their voices, but they are absolutely elated. Even now they’re praising my feet, praising me. They’re happier than they ever were as hu-”\n \n“Don’t.” Alan’s voice was ice. Even the giant witch was stunned silent. “You can do whatever you want with me…Lucida. But please just…Stop talking about them.”\n \n“Very well.” Surprisingly, the Witch agreed and shook her head. “If you didn’t want to know the answer you shouldn’t have asked the question. Silly huma-” Yet again her sentence cut off, this time with no input from Alan. Her eyes turned to the door. There wasn’t a sound, but he was certain she sensed something.\n \nThe boots that were once Matthew and Jaime pulled back as Lucida stood back up. “I’ll be back.” She was out the door in seconds.\n \nThe silence was bliss with her gone. Anything other than hearing her describe…that…any longer. “Gods…” Alan retched. The idea that just one room over his friends were so…so…violated. He never could have imagined it, and now that Witch was out there doing heaven knows what. She couldn’t return and take his life soon enough. Anything to put a stop to this torment.\n \n \nTwo hours.\n \nHe was forced to wait two, agonizing, dismal hours in silence before Lucida returned.\n \nThe pale figure stepped, or rather slid gracefully through the doorway. Each step was a tremor that forced Alan’s attention. Lucida seemed particularly happy. That didn’t bode well.\n \n“Welcome back.” His voice cracked with a dry remark.\n \n“Sorry it took me so long.” Lucida replied jovially. “You must be my lucky charm human. My luck has turned around since you and your friends arrived!”\n \nHe braced himself.\n \n“New boots, and another human who entered my domain! A woman at that!”\n \nBut nothing could have readied him for that. It was only then did he realize that one of Lucida’s hands was clenched.\n \nA sickening feeling welled up within. There was no way. No possible way. There were countless women out there. The odds of it being her were astronomical. Fate wouldn’t be so cruel nor would she be so foolish.\n \n“Behold!” Lucida was all smiles as she deposited her hand along the table outside of the jar. The human girl collapsed on the table in the nude, porcelain skin with long brown hair. She looked up and locked eyes with the man in the glass jar.\n \n“Marie.”\n \nHis friend.\n \nHis companion.\n \nHis fiancé.\n \n“Alan!” Marie ran over to the glass, as did Alan. Both met on opposite ends, mere inches apart. Were it not for the prison that held him their hands would’ve rested over one another.\n \n“Marie, what are you doing here?!”\n \nMarie’s eyes began to water with joy. “You never came home from the woods so we began to fear the worst. Everyone was starting to give up, so I wandered inside and…”\n \n“And then I happened.” Lucida finished for her. “I see you two humans are acquainted with one another.” The Witch offered them a warm smile. “How sweet that love finds a way to reach even here. It warms my heart.”\n \nLiar. There was no way such a beast had a heart. At least for humans like them.\n \n“I’m happy to have allowed you two this final reunion.” Her voice was surprisingly sincere. Alan paled as he saw her fingers closing in on Marie.\n \nThe human girl’s eyes widened. “…Final…? No!” Once the realization hit her she desperately grabbed at the glass, but Lucida’s fingers easily plucked her regardless.\n \n“Marie!” Alan’s fists bashed against the glass over and over again, both hands screamed in agony. He silenced the pain with more bashing. If his hands could feel pain it meant he wasn’t hitting hard enough. “You leave her alone! Take me instead!”\n \n“I’m afraid I cannot human.” Lucida stated flatly. She began to take her booming steps back to the cauldron. “It seems that the potion is done brewing. There’s just one final ingredient left before we can proceed...” Marie was dangled before her immense face, forced to face the warm but merciless gaze of the witch. “One human woman.”\n \n“NO!” Alan smashed once again, this time he heard his hands crack.\n \nMarie made similar protests, but Lucida’s giant voice dwarfed any sounds she made. All her struggles meant nothing in the giant Witch’s grasp. “You know I must thank you human…Alan was it?” She smiled, bringing her hand over the cauldron. Her other hand was poised with the same two fingers that plucked pieces from the dragon. “Were it not for you this human girl would likely have never arrived, then I would’ve had to make a different potion. Let’s see here…” Her gaze wandered carelessly to her book nearby.\n \n“Don’t do it! Marie!” It was pointless. He knew it. But what else could he do? Lucida was right. This was entirely his fault, and now he was about to pay the price for it.\n \n“Oh boy. Multiple steps. Bear with me girl.” Lucida remarked in an annoyed tone.\n \nIt was his fault that he got goaded into wandering the woods. His fault Jaime and Matthew went with him. His fault Marie ventured out looking for him.\n“MARIE!”\n \n“ALAN!”\n \n“Left arm…”\n \nLucida’s fingers grabbed Marie’s left arm, and without pause pulled it clean off. The torn limb was dropped into the cauldron below. Lucida completely ignored the pain filled shrieks Marie let out.\n \nHis eyes widened. “By the Gods, MARIE!” Alan took several steps back and tackled the glass. “Marie!” All he could do was call her name, call her name and watch while his fiancé was mutilated.\n \n“Left leg…” Like the arm she pulled Lucida did the same with the leg. The pain was too much for the little human to handle; her body slumped over on the spot. Blood and bits of gore trickled down after the discarded leg into the cauldron. She was still breathing…for now.\n \n“Marie goddammit!” Alan collapsed on his knees, helpless to stop this nightmare. “STOP THIS LUCIDA! I LOVE HER!”\n \n“Right arm…” Lucida didn’t so much as bat an eye, doing the same once again.\n \nThis wasn’t right. This was not right. But it was happening. Alan had no choice, no choice but to accept that this was reality.\n \n“Right leg…” And just like that Marie was a quadriplegic. The massive digits clenched tightly on what remained of her and crushed her into paste, paste that Lucida carefully sprinkled around the cauldron. “And then sprinkle the remains evenly…” After a few moments the liquid turned a light blue, Lucida stepping back happily. “Success!”\n \nAlan was forced to raise his gaze as the witch returned for him. He could already feel her massive fingers wrapping around his small body, bringing him up before her visage.\n \n“And now you’re all that remains.” Lucida’s ever present smile seemed to mock him as she set the man on her open palm. Her ethereal beauty made her all the more monstrous.\n \n“Just get it over with. Whatever you want. I don’t care.” He was done with this. “Just end it already.”\n \nThe Witch tilted her head. “Well, I was considering keeping you as a plaything actually. You seem to bring good fortune, and I have some new boots that could use upkeep. You could spend your life with your friends as my shoe cleaner.” It was a harmless suggestion on her part. Alan knew she was speaking in that strange sincerity of hers; but it felt almost cruel given what she’d just done.\n \n“…”\n \nHe could sense her eyes on him, practically seeing through his soul. “…But it looks like that won’t work anymore. I can see it. You’re dead inside.”\n \nHow observant of her. If Alan had any will left inside of him he’d probably have made some wry remark along those lines.\n \nLucida sighed, tucking a bit of her black hair behind a pale ear. “Fine, I hate letting ingredients go to waste.”\n \nHe knew what came next.\n \nThe perfect and plush lips of the Witch parted open. A gale of warm winds assaulted the human’s tiny body. The humid, pink interior awaited him, already salivating in anticipation of his taste. Her tongue broke through the threshold, severing saliva strands and reaching out to Alan while her hand tilted to slide him downwards. He landed face first against the slimy surface. The smothering sensation of her taste buds and saliva overwhelmed all his senses.\n \nLucida’s tongue retracted and her lips began to shut as darkness soon overtook the innards of her mouth. Alan offered no resistance. His body was half submerged in the woman’s saliva and the other half was smothered by her tongue. She was savoring him, he vaguely realized. She was sucking him like a candy. Her voice thundered louder than ever in his ears as she hummed in delight.\n \nAt least he tasted good he supposed.\n \nAlan’s body was slowly withering within Lucida’s mouth. Even without the benefit of light he could feel his skin pruning as what little moisture he had was sucked from him. Lucida left no part of him untouched. Her tongue pressed him against the rock hard surface of her teeth and violated him in every conceivable way, then would flip him over and press him against the roof of her mouth to probe even more.\n \nEventually, perhaps even minutes later, he began to feel his body being carried further in. The pools of saliva flowed back with him like a river, splashing downwards. Everything grew tighter. Muscles constricted against his body and forced him further and further down. The saliva that coated Alan made it all too easy. Before long there weren’t even the muscles. He was just falling, down below he heard the bubbling of the acidic fate that awaited him.\n \n------------------------------------------\n \n“Mmmmmmmmmmm~” Lucida let out a deep moan after she swallowed. “I’ve never had raw human before. That was delightful.” He didn’t even struggle, how thoughtful of him.\n \nThe Witch returned the empty human jar back to its rightful place on the shelf and turned back to her cauldron. That human girl was a stroke of luck, so she couldn’t get careless now. Her eyes shifted to the recipe book. Such a rare ingredient meant she could try something special. Now where was that page?\n \n“Growth potion…Ah here it is….Hmm…Three Cyclops eyes and two Minotaur horns…” Lucida smiled as she stepped back for the proper jars.\n \n“Whee chuckled I, what fun what fun.”\n \n“Halloween night, when the old witch runs.”\n \n"],["“I wonder what you taste like.” She licked her lips while\nmoaning seductively as she leaned her smiling face in closer towards her tiny\ntied-up victim. Her beauty mesmerized him, and he seemed to be in a trance as\nshe came closer. She suddenly stopped inches away from his face and he felt her\nwarm minty fresh breath exhale through her mouth to stimulate his fully erect\ncock. She noticed and let out a gasp before she spoke to him “you seem happy to\nsee me, hey, it's not polite to stare.” She said as she lifted her hand and\ngently poked him in the stomach with her large index-finger. He tried to show\nno reaction and turned his head away from her. “Is this your first time being\nnaked with a woman?” She asked with a giggle. \n\n“Too scared to talk? Awww, don’t fear me, listen, I hated the others, so when\nthe shrinking virus got them; yes, I enjoyed crushing them to satisfy my need\nfor revenge and arousal, but you are cute, I really like you, trust me, we can\nbe good friends, or perhaps, more than friends.” Her tongue slowly darted out\nbeneath his cock and gently moved backward and forward to pleasure him. He\nmoaned out with surprise, and she felt victorious. She finally got his reaction,\nbut it was not enough; she wanted more. She leaned in and closed her lips\naround his cock. She enjoyed the taste of him and took in his scent with every\ninhale. The intense warm wetness and constant movement caused him to moan out\nas she continued to pleasure him. She knew he was about to cum. \n\nShe suddenly pulled back to tease him, wait for him to calm down, suck his cock\nuntil he was about to cum, and pull back again. She did this many times until\nhe was desperate and begging her to finally force him to cum. “No! You will cum\nonly when I allow you too! Until then, I will keep teasing you to the edge and\npull back. A fitting punishment for running away from me earlier when I found\nyou tiny. You should know that I believe in rewarding good behavior, too, so if\nyou behave and obey your giantess owner; I promise to respect you and treat you\nwell. I am a woman with needs, and I did have a crush on you before you shrunk.\nI would prefer to have a good relationship with you. But how I treat you from\nthis point is entirely up to you. I will give you a choice. Do you want to stay\nwith me, or do you want me to free you and let you leave me unharmed?”\n\n\n\nHe was silent, time passed, and she appeared disappointed. She\nstarted to become self-conscious and question herself. He really had no\nfeelings for her at all? Had she gone too far and damaged their potential\nrelationship by saying and doing this? \nShe started to think of how best to untie him. Suddenly, he screamed out\n“I LOVE YOU! I WANT TO STAY WITH YOU! I AM YOURS!” This emotional outburst caused\nher to smile as she felt her heartbeat faster. He committed to their\nrelationship now. “I love you and I will always be there for you but first, let\nme help you with this.” She said as she leaned in closer and closed her lips\naround his cock. He moaned out without restraint while knowing that she would finally\nrelease him. She continued to pleasure him until she felt his cock twitch and\nhe screamed out while his muscles involuntarily spasmed during his orgasm. A\nbig load of warm cum shot out of his cock and onto her tongue as she continued\nto suck him. It was the longest orgasm he ever had that continued to shoot out\ncum every few seconds until he was sexually exhausted and breathing heavily as\nhis giantess girlfriend continued to pleasure and play with him all night.GiantessDiscord.com\n"],[""],[""],["","",""]]}
